  "Statement of Thomas Neill regarding his experiences working in malarial research during the spring of 2010. Original statement given February the 9th, 2011. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "This is when things... started to go wrong. When things started to get weird. I don't know if it had anything to do with Neil selling that syringe. I mean, I don't know how it... *could* have, but that's when the trouble started.",
  "Before anyone could stop him, he grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran into the mosquito room. God knows what he was hoping to achieve. Spray a few cages to death in some petty act of revenge, maybe? He never got the chance.",
  "Why? I can't find any other indication of an interest in the paranormal, nothing to indicate this area of study appealed to him. And why stay after everything that happened with Prentiss? Is it just loyalty or could it be something --",
  "I-I was. I am. It's...",
  "It... it's a performance review thing, going over some files for it.",
  "[Abruptly] Confidential files that you... legally you shouldn't really be looking at them. Please, er, please leave, Martin.",
  "No. Thank you, Martin.",
  "I need to find a better place to do these recordings."
