  "Continued statement of Trevor Hebert, regarding the latter years of his career as a vampire hunter.",
  "Original statement given July 10th, 2010.",
  "Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "Note: several pages are missing from the file around the time that he apparently did *not* die of lung cancer in the institute.",
  "She died in the end.",
  "Sad old thing but she didn't deserve that. Always wondered what would have happened if I'd gotten there a bit sooner.",
  "Trouble is, once they've really got their teeth into you you're as good as dead even if they don't drain you. Gushing on the floor or bloating a vampire's belly doesn't make much difference to the poor fool bleeding out.",
  "I often wondered if I was mad, you know. I mean, no one else seems to have seen these things, and I found plenty across my life. Perhaps I just got the smell of them.",
  "Like, no one else ever really got away and my early escape from Sylvia MacDonald gave me a sense that could pick them out.",
  "There's a sharpness to them. They're hunters. But over the years I've become a hunter as well and maybe predators recognize each other. All I know is, these days I can almost smell the blood coming off them.",
  "That's not to say I can't be wrong though. I can be very wrong indeed.",
  "I found Alard Dupont in the summer of 1982 and murdered him shortly afterwards. I used the word murder here, where I have not before, because he was the only one I've killed I know to have been human.",
  "In most ways I regret his death, but there is a certain comfort to it. If I was just a serial killer with a hallucination I don't see why my mind wouldn't have made Dupont vampire as well.",
  "The fact that I was able to kill normal people reassures me that the creatures I hunt are real. Do you understand?",
  "Heroin is calm. It's a small chunk of peace in a world that's full of nothing but hard edges. It's hard to put that down permanently, but the hunt...",
  "The hunt is a purpose. It's not just a way to get through the day, it's a reason for there to be a day at all.",
  "I tried to give it up for a while after Dupont but it burned in me far deeper than any hitch I got when I was clocking.",
  "Back in '82 though those addictions were running pretty much unchecked. It had been several years since I'd last found a vampire and every waking moment I wasn't high was spent in keen lookout for anything suspicious.",
  "But none of those things were the case, so dwelling on them is pointless.",
  "I don't know if Dupont was technically a mute or not. I've had no real experience with the condition and he didn't seem to have any problems with his hearing.",
  "Either way I never saw him speak, which by now I'm sure you know is what I would consider a significant warning sign for vampirism.",
  "A friend of mine I shared a shelter with some weeks before, and who shared a similar weakness for narcotics, had mentioned how amazing it was that his dealer was always able to know exactly what he was after without either of them saying.",
  "In retrospect I should have realized that it didn't exactly match the vampires I'd met before, who'd never displayed any sort of mind-reading, but I was aching for a killer.",
  "What struck me about him more than that, though, were the scars on his neck.",
  "I later discovered they were from a dog attack when he was younger, but at the time I was convinced they were connected to Dupont so I found were allowed Dupont made his handovers at Piccadilly Gardens and I started to watch.",
  "Then came the moment that fully convinced me I had to kill Dupont.",
  "As he sat there on the bench two policemen walked past me heading towards him. They took no notice of me, nobody notices a tramp.",
  "But as they walked up the path towards the figure on the bench one of the police nudged his partner and gestured towards him. They clearly considered him suspicious and began to walk over.",
  "As they got close though Dupont looked up and made eye contact with them.",
  "They stopped just for a moment and he nodded gently. The policeman looked at each other, turned, and walked away.",
  "That was all I needed to be sure of what he was.",
  "The idea I have come to since then, that the two police officers were simply on the take and hadn't immediately recognized him, didn't occur to me until much later.",
  "It was an overcast day and it seems to me that Dupont was keeping in the shadows just as I thought he would. I kept watching as he made a few more transactions.",
  "I was craving a hit of my own by that point. There was a much more intense rush I was chasing just then and it pushed all thoughts of junk to the back of my mind.",
  "So I watched Dupont head inside, adopting my camouflage of softly asking passersby for change and waited.",
  "It was about two hours later that he emerged, another man following close behind him. I didn't recognize them, I mean there's no reason I should have, but Dupont's new friend was almost as big as he was.",
  "I was quiet as I limped through the rubbish that covered the alleyway and I silently drew my trusty hammer. After a minute they turned in to a doorway and took out a key. The door opened and they both stepped inside.",
  "I had a sudden alarm at the thought of getting locked out and being unable to reach him. Forgetting stealth, I grabbed the door and flung it open. They turned to face me.",
  "I charged him with a cry, slamming the hammer into Dupont's shoulder and knocking him to the ground with a sickening crack.",
  "I will never forget the moment I heard Alard Dupont scream.",
  "There was such a piercing sound and something I'd never expected. In a moment everything I'd built up in my head over the past couple of days shattered and I felt a sudden panic at what I'd done. What I was doing.",
  "His friend screamed as well and started to run back out the door. I don't know if he got a good look at me. Given the police never came around to question me I guess not.",
  "Dupont was still screaming, that horrid sound overriding all other thoughts. Blood was streaming from his face where it had hit the ground and I didn't know what to do. I had to get out of there, but that noise was too much.",
  "I couldn't focus, couldn't do anything, so I hit him again. Hard. In the head. And then he was quiet, and everything was horribly still.",
  "He just lay there.",
  "I have never felt anything like the shame and disgust I felt at that moment.",
  "I tried to burn his body more out of habit than anything else, but it didn't really take and I fled out into the street before the police arrived.",
  "I won't bother with details. It was very similar to my hunt for Jane Lewis except that the victim made it out alive this time.",
  "I wonder why it is that I only ever seemed to find them just before they attack. It can't be that they spent every night feeding, the world would be a bloodbath.",
  "Hannah was my fifth confirmed vampire and the last one, assuming I don't find another before the cancer takes me.",
  "I really considered myself retired, resting after a life spent defending the world from the darkness. Because that's what I thought it was, you know. Vampires were what lurked in the dark. The only thing that lurked in the dark.",
  "Last year though, just before my diagnosis, I met something that made me rethink this.",
  "I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that winter is a hard time to be homeless. Doesn't matter how many times you've done it, when that first cold wind blows through you it's like some awful death coming to you.",
  "The last one was really bad. A bunch of the shelters I normally hit up had closed up shop and those that were left tended to fill up fast.",
  "I do pretty okay given I'm a well-known face and all that but I still felt the pressure to scrape enough cash together to secure my spot early. Even then there'd be a couple of times a week that I still ended up in the cold.",
  "My old bones don't do so well at that these days, so I was keeping quite a close eye on the comings and goings around the night shelters of Manchester, and after a few weeks I started to notice something strange.",
  "She looked pretty normal for the place, and I could even write off the distant, neutral expression as the sort of trauma all too common among my people. That's why I didn't pay her any mind the first time it happened, or the second.",
  "When I noticed it happening a third time I finally started to pay attention, though I didn't approach her immediately.",
  "I did ask about her the following morning but even the staff didn't seem to know anything. I decided to keep a lookout and if she turned up again I would confront her.",
  "Well, she did.",
  "Well, he walked out without a sound gathering up his belongings quietly and leaving an empty bed.",
  "I waited wide awake, hand on my knife, breathing steady. Sure enough, a few minutes later, in she walks, no backpack or gear of any sort, and sat on Craig's bed.",
  "I stood up and walked towards her. As soon as she saw me her posture changed and she became defensive, although the expression on her face and never changed from that blankness.",
  "I've been sober for three years at that point but I felt like I desperately wanted to get high, and I knew that the best place to get some was out in the night.",
  "There was a long pause as that woman gazed levelly at me.",
  "Then she broke into a run through the door and out. I followed. Didn't matter to me whether she was a vampire or not, there was something wrong and I wanted to find out what was going on.",
  "I chased her out into the road. It was cold and still and if anyone saw us they didn't make a sound.",
  "She ran strangely, more like a spasm, smooth steps, and her arms shifted in weird ways as she moved. I'm not as spry as I once was and my lungs were obviously shot but I managed to keep pace with her.",
  "I could feel it in my blood. It was a hunt and I always felt stronger on a hunt.",
  "I could feel movement from inside the arm itself. It wasn't a vampire but it definitely wasn't human.",
  "With this other arm it took a wide sweeping swing at me, but I was prepared and ducked below the flailing punch.",
  "I got my knife to try and threaten the thing, maybe get it to answer some questions, but I misjudged the draw and ended up slashing it slightly across its stomach. It wasn't a deep cut or a long one but apparently it was enough.",
  "A whole body began to shudder as tiny shapes began to stream out of the wound.",
  "Thousands and thousands of spiders.",
  "She opened her mouth at last, as if to scream and more poured out. Tens of thousands of skittering legs and evil little eyes. I screamed and started to back up as the dark shapes pooled around her feet and spread out in a twitching circle.",
  "For a second I was worried they were coming for me but then they just scurried off into the shadows and crevices of nearby buildings, until the street was empty of everything except this woman.",
  "She was still standing upright, but from the open mouth, I could see that her body was completely hollow, save for a few cobwebs that I could just make out under the streetlights.",
  "I ran the hell away and that's the last creature I encountered.",
  "That's my whole story. You're welcome to it.",
  "When I thought it was just vampires about, I might have given you people as miss as a bunch of kooks. But if there's other stuff around out there... maybe you know more about it than me.",
  "And maybe you could use a bit more information on vampires.",
  "It's a shame I'm on the way out.",
  "I will miss the hunt.",
  "[agitated] Well, this is certainly a surprise. Martin informed me that Mr. Herbert passed away after making his initial statement, so it is rather a shock to find this misfiled addition to his original, even if it is partially incomplete.",
  "What's more, actually checking the hospital and death records for both London and Manchester, I can't find any record of Mr. Herbert's death. Then again, I could find no record of him alive, either, after the date of the statement.",
  "I can't find any indication of muteness, but aside from that, everything checks out.",
  "As for the spider person, the only proof of its existence seems to be that I am far too unlucky for it to simply be an old tramp hallucination.",
  "I need to have some words with Martin.",
  "Sit. Why did you lie to me about Trevor?",
  "[agitated] Why did you tell me he was dead?",
  "*Trevor Herbert*. The tramp? The vampire hunter. You told me he died.",
  "[venomously] So that's it. Just a misunderstanding.",
  "Because you keep lying to me, Martin!",
  "I don't know. But you are.",
  "It was in the old document room, just next to where you used to sleep. Your handwriting. \"If the others find out I've been lying\" -- lying about *what*, Martin?",
  "I *can't* forget it. Everyone in this place has so many goddamn secrets and I can't trust a word you say. Not about this and not about Trevor --",
  "[scoffing] *Fire* you -- fine.",
  "[slight laugh] Right, I--I... uh... I believe you.",
  "[audibly smiling] Yes, um, I jus... I won't mention it to Elias. Just between us.",
  "To be quite honest, Martin,, I'm really rather relieved."

  "Sorry, who's... who's Trev--",
  "[nervously] But I mean he... did. Didn't he?",
  "I mean, I--I didn't ever actually meet him. I just heard some of the other researchers mentioning it.",
  "Yeah, well, I could've sworn they said he died. I mean... maybe they just said he looks like death or something --",
  "I really thought they said he was dead.",
  "[stammering] Yes. You seem to be taking this kind of personal--",
  "Where did you get that? Have you been going through the bin?",
  "Look, just forget about it, okay? Please.",
  "Okay! Okay! Okay. Just... just... promise you won't... fire me.",
  "I lied on my CV.",
  "I don't have a master's in parapsychology. I don't even have a degree.",
  "I was 17, my mum, she had -- she had some problems and I ended up dropping out of school trying to support us. I tried everything but nowhere was hiring, so I just kind of started to lie on my application, sending them out to just about anywhere.",
  "For some reason my lie about parapsychology got me an interview with Elias and -- and then a job here. But most of my employment details are made up. I'm only 29.",
  "...why are you smiling?",
  "[hesitant] So you don't mind?"
