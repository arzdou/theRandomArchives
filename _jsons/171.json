  "The curling, cascading intricacies of collagen and marrow.",
  "You know why I'm here?",
  "It's too late for that now.",
  "I can't let you carry on like this.",
  "What happened, Jared?",
  "I thought you only worked on the willing.",
  "No, it doesn't.",
  "No you won't.",
  "Let's hear it.",
  "Sort of, yes.",
  "Cultivation notes for *Fuertisium reese.",
  "*[^1] Commonly known as the Gristlebloom Orchid.",
  "[^1]: [Transcriber's Note: Not a real orchid genus, but spelling modeled after the closest genus I could find, *Fuertisiella*.",
  "Following standard convention, the species name is not capitalized.",
  "While proper conditions for development can be tricky to get precisely right, caution should be exercised as -- should an ideal environment be created -- this plant can grow and grow and grow.",
  "The soil should be prepared first, a rich and earthy cocktail of insecurity and self-hatred that allows the roots to twist and contort freely.",
  "The temperature should be kept the steady, humid warmth of air conditioners struggling to cope with the perspiration of a dozen bodies pushing themselves too hard, while the lights must be kept at a harsh, fluorescent glare.",
  "Counterintuitively, growth is most effective when the orchid is suffering from aggressive dehydration, and it is vitally important that the air roots be rarely praised, and only for the flowers' appearance and growth.",
  "Above all, the deepest fear must be laced throughout what the Gristlebloom Orchid is fed: That they're not enough.",
  "That their inadequacies are embedded all the way into their flesh, and they must always and forever be *more*.",
  "This unspoken terror can be viewed in the intricate lattices that marble the gory petals of a well-cared for Gristlebloom as it expands and swells and grows to its full and bulbous potential.",
  "Even if there were mirrors in this place, Reese could not possibly recognize himself.",
  "Not because anything that might once have registered as a human body has long since blossomed into sinewy flowers and muscles and burst skin, but because -- were he to see himself, the only image in his mind would be the him he was so afraid to be.",
  "And the Gristlebloom Orchid grows.",
  "The agonies of this gore-streaked orchid are pointedly exquisite as it willingly and keenly pushes its physical form past any recognizable point of pain and shuddering anxiety until it towers over your garden, dripping blood and bitter sweat.",
  "Cultivation notes for *Gristleium patricia*.",
  "[^2] Commonly known as the Bone Rose.",
  "[^2]: [Transcriber's Note: The genus for all roses is *Rosa*; therefore, this spelling comes from *gristle*, or cartilage, plus *-ium.",
  "While the Gristlebloom Orchid may be the most *eye-catching* of the plants that you will find in the mortal garden, the Bone Rose is perhaps the most delicate.",
  "Thin and brittle, it is constantly on the verge of collapsing under its own weight, even as its ossified stems reach and twist and stretch in a desperate attempt for closeness.",
  "*To be wanted you must be less.",
  "The temperature should be kept cold for optimal development, the coldness of rejection, of hostile and pitying glances cast over a hated body.",
  "A coldness that creeps through the bones and lashes the vicious iciness to the flower's core.",
  "Light should be unrelenting, allowing every flaw and mark and sag to be stared at and warped and ogled.",
  "With this preparation, the Bone Rose will conceive a grotesque horror of its own flesh, of the skin and fats and all that makes a body present.",
  "It will tear and starve and leak until there is nought but bones, the hungry bones so desperate to be touched, to be held.",
  "To be wanted.",
  "Patricia is beautiful at last, so sharp and narrow and hard.",
  "Her angles and creamy white entirety is the center of the garden for all to admire.",
  "But she strains and shakes and fears the wind that pushes and bends the brittle stiffness of the bones.",
  "It takes every drop of her strength to keep herself aloft, to not collapse in a heap of splintered femur and broken rib.",
  "There is no moment of her new existence that is not a shuddering, terrified effort.",
  "She is beautiful.",
  "And she cannot allow herself to lose that at any cost.",
  "She cannot shatter into fleshy ugliness again.",
  "The Bone Rose, properly cultivated, will be a fearful and wonderful centerpiece for a carefully tended mortal garden.",
  "Cultivation notes for *Cicadium leopold.",
  "*[^3] Commonly known as the Cutaway Tulip.",
  "[^3]: [Transcriber's Note: Every tulip falls in the genus *Tulipa*.",
  "Spelling for this one just based phonetically.",
  "At the edges of the mortal garden, if one is lucky, one may find the rare Cutaway Tulip, the pride of any diligent gardener.",
  "While easy to grow to a small size with some casually applied insecurities, to create a true masterpiece of carved and peeled and sculpted flesh requires a lengthy and involved cultivation.",
  "Ensuring a properly grotesque blossom, an elegant and graceful flowering, is more in the pruning than in the preparation.",
  "The soil can be anything mulched in hostility to self-worth, and the light and temperature must simply be kept at a level to allow the appropriate growth of an obsession.",
  "An obsession, with the changing and hacking of itself, that from stem to root to petal it cuts and breaks and sticks itself into ever-new configurations and shapes, each a new summit of repulsive symmetry and stomach-churning perfection.",
  "A perfection sought in the blades and the shears of the gardener.",
  "All the edge wielded by its own wildly waving roots, eagerly digging into a knotted and knitted form and pulling itself apart.",
  "The Cutaway Tulip's growth is less reliant than other blooms on the moment-to-moment terror of themselves, the sharpened, pointed fear of a form you are appalled to look upon.",
  "Instead, what must be grown and fed and watered is the lingering, nagging dread of falling short of what could be.",
  "At the final, glorious culmination that a body may someday achieve, the ever-retreating perfections that sit always on the tip of a knife.",
  "But also growing with the flower must be that other dread: Not of perfection to be hunted, but of decay to be fled.",
  "The wrinkled, graying translucent marks of encroaching mortality, a body that seeks to turn all that look like you into a moldering parody.",
  "And the fearful slicing and desperate stabbing that is no longer to seek the golden promise of an eternal beauty but a tearful attempt to rewind a spring that ticks itself ever looser with every snap of the clock face.",
  "Leopold is aware of what he has become, of the bleeding, twitching caricature of a human body he inhabits, the ribbons of himself that are pruned and broken and woven into *dazzling* petals.",
  "He would cry, but he has no idea where his tear ducts are anymore.",
  "Cultivation notes for *Sopranium maeve*.",
  "[^4] Commonly known as the Lily of the Damned.",
  "[^4]: [Transcriber's Note: All lilies are *Lilium*.",
  "Any soil works for a Lily of the Damned, though some contend a rough and damp texture causes them to blossom faster.",
  "The important aspect to bear in mind is to never allow the lily to forget its physical existence.",
  "Temperatures can be hot or cold as long as it is uncomfortable, and light levels need only be high if the preoccupation with its body's presence has a visual component.",
  "Most importantly, the absence of any transcendence or death should always be emphasized when watering or pruning.",
  "Transhumanism, religion -- all must be roundly dismissed or mocked, at all times with the clear conclusion that the meat from which the lily blooms is the only form of being it will ever enjoy.",
  "The flowers that spring from a Lily of the Damned are.",
  "less predictable than those of other denizens of the mortal garden, being haphazard black growths of calcified fluid and sinuous, dangling nerves.",
  "They can grow very fast, but are in no danger of dominating any arrangement, as they will by nature attempt to retreat beneath the soil, hiding the painful existence that horrifies them so from any that might be watching, including themselves.",
  "Periodically, if you wish to display and grow your lily to its best advantage, you must seize whatever part of it remains above ground and *pull*, bringing it up into the open air.",
  "Use as much force as you have available without worry of dislodging it entirely.",
  "The lily's roots go deep, and can withstand almost any attempt to dislodge them.",
  "This is Maeve's nightmare.",
  "There is no other word for it.",
  "To be trapped, unmoving, within the body that has betrayed her so often, feeling every sensation as it grows and warps and sprouts, never knowing what new mutation it will visit on her next.",
  "She is unable to even hide.",
  "There is no promise of the peaceful sleep of the innocent dead, not the dream of a digital escape of the hell her body has become.",
  "She is here, and she is trapped in the same soft prison of skin she has *always* so despised.",
  "The mortal garden grows and twists and screams and bleeds.",
  "It is loved by the hands that tend it, but that love sows only misery and fear.",
  "It is the worst place that has ever been beautiful, and it should not exist.",
  "Um, uh -- Sorry.",
  "There's too many.",
  "I can't save everyone.",
  "I can't save *anyone*.",
  "Spare me the crude *philosophy*.",
  "Feel the terror and despair as your garden grows.",
  "Let it flow through you and *blossom*.",

  "I just --  It didn't seem worth it.",
  "I didn't -- *hate* him like I hated her.",
