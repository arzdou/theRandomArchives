  "I said it was fine.",
  "What are you doing?",
  "No. I just need you to answer the question.",
  "Didn't know who the killer was last time. This time it's simpler. And... And Basira's not a police officer anymore.",
  "You think we should be looking for other suspects?",
  "Has a lot of distortion, some screaming and a recording of you seeing the body, you claim for the first time. Always suspicious when two suspects are each other's only alibi.",
  "Which one should we be asking, by the way? The man with the knife hands or the woman trapped in your 'magic corridors'?",
  "Well, if your witnesses appear back in this universe, maybe the situation will change.",
  "Otherwise, it's an easy choice: answer my question or I pin it on you.",
  "Let me tell you how this works, Mr. Blackwood. I've got a hell of a workload, no partner, and full operational discretion to make this whole situation go away. That means you help me, or I make things very unpleasant for you.",
  "So, help me stop a killer. Where is Jonathan Sims?",
  "Don't lie to me.",
  "Everyone I've talked to says you and him were close.",
  "Did he have any other friends? Anyone outside the Institute he might have talked to?",
  "There's nowhere? No-one he might turn to?",
  "[Sigh] Right. Get lost. Send Stoker in.",
  "Unless you know something else.",
  "That your name?",
  "You want me to leave this running?",
  "I just need anything you know on the possible whereabouts of Jonathan Sims. Anywhere he feels safe, any friends or associates he might turn to?",
  "You're sure? Nothing that might help me find him? If you're hiding something out of some sort of loyalty...",
  "And you haven't seen Sasha James either?",
  "Can't say yet. But looking at it, yeah, I think Sims killed her, too.",
  "You've got quite a turnover. Anything you want to tell me about it?",
  "Oh... [amused grunt] You're done, Mr. Stoker. Send in Bouchard.",
  "What is...? No. Just a couple of questions.",
  "I don't suppose you know how to turn this off?",
  "So you don't think he did it?",
  "People can surprise you.",
  "You want him to be a murderer?",
  "I'm the one asking the questions.",
  "[Pause] The victim isn't someone we have on file. Doesn't match any missing persons. Still a John Doe.",
  "I say something funny?",
  "Right. So. Do you know anything about the current whereabouts of Jonathan Sims? Anywhere he might be staying? Any friends he might have contacted?",
  "Just answer the question.",
  "What do you know about the current whereabouts of Jonathan Sims?",
  "I can drag this down to the station if you want, you weird little freak. Maybe Sims didn't do this alone.",
  "They know enough. They got a call and sent me down here. That's how it works.",
  "If you're right, what's to stop me kicking your teeth in? No cameras down here, remember. I can always just turn off that little recorder of yours. Smash it up.",
  "I... don't know what you're talking about.",
  "You shut the hell up, or I swear I'll kill you.",
  "I'm going to kill you, someday.",
  "Shut up. It wasn't my fault.",
  "You can't know that.",
  "You've made your point.",
  "One day, someone is going to kill you. I really hope it's me."

 "MARTIN": [
  "Sorry. I just... I feel more comfortable with it on.",
  "Yeah, right, so, um... Statement of Martin Blackwood, interviewed by Detective D-- Tonner. February 18th, two thousand and --",
  "I... I'm making a statement. Isn't that what you want? My statement?",
  "Oh. Okay. I mean, y-you wanted a statement last time. About...it was... when I found Gertrude. Or at least your partner did.",
  "Oh. Look, y-you're sure it was him? I mean, I know, I know... but I can't... He wouldn't!",
  "I... I don't think it was him.",
  "Wh-- N-No! No, I mean, not -- Look, that tape that we gave you...",
  "I told you that there was someone else there. It may...",
  "Y-You can't! Th-That's not how this works.",
  "But you're the police!",
  "[Pause] I don't know.",
  "What? [Inordinately pleased] Did they? I mean... I mean, who said that? I, I, I guess, I mean, more than the rest, yeah okay, but --",
  "I... No, I don't really... think so. I don't, don't think he had much of a life outside of this place.",
  "He never talked about his friends, worked all hours... No. I'm sorry.",
  "What about Sasha?",
  "No. I just... Bring her back safe, okay?",
  "I'll send Tim in.",
  "-- but she looked like she'd seen a, well, you know...",
  "So, I'm just saying, she spends all that time in there with Elias, and then leaves like that? Maybe he told her something.",
  "Maybe they said something about Sasha, y'know?",
  "Don't you say that. Don't you *dare* say that!",
  "She didn't care. Just wanted to know where he was.",
  "No. No it doesn't! Nothing about this makes sense!",
  "I don't know who that old man was, but John would *never* hurt Sasha.",
  "It was only for a second. And what with that weird finger guy, and the door... I mean, it d-didn't look like her.",
  "Tim, we've got to talk about this!",
  "Huh. [Calling after] Tim? Tim, did you turn the reco--"
 ],
 "TIM": [
  "No. You can turn it off.",
  "Huh. Seems about right. Look, just... just leave it on, or do you want to do this somewhere else?",
  "Suppose you want my statement?",
  "[Bitter laugh] Look, if I knew, I'd tell you. We haven't talked too much lately.",
  "No. You think she's dead?",
  "Sounds right. More bodies for the archive.",
  "[Snort] Yeah, don't take a job here.",
  "Or maybe she just hates it here. Like a normal person.",
  "She's dead, Martin. Come on! Even *you're* not that blind. He got her, too.",
  "I didn't. It was that detective. Y-You try talking to her about it?",
  "Fine. If it wasn't him, it must have been that thing we saw.",
  "Look, I'm sorry. It's just this place. [Sigh] Bad things happen and eventually you don't come back.",
  "I'm going to go lie down."
 ],
 "ELIAS": [
  "So, what can I do to help? You want my account? My sworn testimony? My statement?",
  "Oh, leave it running. I'm sure John will want to review the tapes when he gets back.",
  "Killed a man in cold blood? Certainly not. He doesn't have the stomach for it.",
  "In John's case, I rather hope so.",
  "Have you had any luck identifying the body yet?",
  "Very well, then I suppose this interview is over. Unless you care to arrest me?",
  "Nothing. Just remembering an old joke.",
  "I was wondering. Is it worth it? Operating the way that you do?",
  "Does the lack of oversight make up for the lack of support?",
  "Everything. I know exactly where he is and who is with him. But I don't think I'm going to tell you.",
  "Please, Detective Tonner. You don't want this to happen in the police station any more than I do.",
  "Your superiors, exactly how aware are they of what you're doing right now?",
  "And then they don't ask any questions, as long as you keep it far away from official police channels.",
  "All you care about is where John is, because you've decided on a course of action, and you're going to follow it through.",
  "Very true. However, you aren't going to do that, Detective. Because of Calvin Benchley.",
  "Calvin Benchley. You recognise the name, don't you Alice? You see, I know what you did.",
  "No? The scar may have faded, but you haven't forgotten.",
  "Did it itch, just a little, when you were burying him?",
  "I will take that as a yes.",
  "If you're smart, you'll go back to the police station and put forward some half-baked cover-up for what happened to your mystery corpse and leave it at that. But I don't think you are smart, so in many ways I'm excited to find out what you do next.",
  "Statement of Alice Tonner, regarding the crimes and death of Calvin Benchley. Statement never given.",
  "Our parents had forbidden us from playing there. It was collapsing, as well as being a known hang-out for vagrants and druggies. We would take turns daring each other to go in there. That day, I dared him. That's why it was my fault.",
  "We had been in the park, when there had been shouting from the building site. Crashes. Violence. Then a long silence.",
  "And nobody asked any questions at all. He was a scumbag, and nobody wants to risk getting a Section 31. He was the first human I dealt with like that, but he certainly wasn't the last.",
  "Do I need to go on, Detective Tonner?",
  "Good. Feel free to see yourself out. If you take any action against myself or this Institute, I will ensure the police become aware of your crimes in a way that cannot be ignored or covered up.",
  "Good day, Detective."
