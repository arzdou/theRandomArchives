  "Statement of Eugene Vanderstock, regarding the creation of Agnes Montague, her life, care, and death. Original statement given November 30th, 2006. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.",
  "Anyone who talks about \"the Blitz spirit\" wasn't there, or wants to paper over their fear with nostalgia. Terrible things happened in the Blackout, and we hurt each other just as much as the Germans hurt us. And I hurt so very many people.",
  "A building fire is a dreadful thing, but so much more dreadful when it's shining out into that night.",
  "Which sounded... amazing. But a few of us pointed out that the Allied air force had a tad more firepower than we did, as none of us were likely to make the rank of Air Marshal anytime soon.",
  "And that's when Arthur proposed his own plan: A chosen one. We would create a messiah, the flame incarnate, one who could usher in this new world, and lead us in what Diego called \"The Scoured Earth.\"",
  "We prayed, and sacrificed, and anointed her body with holy oil and a crown of kindling. I protested the last one, felt we could do better than to ape the Christians, but I was shouted down.",
  "And on top of that, sleeping peacefully among the fire, a baby. Untouched, unharmed, and to our eyes, alight with a burning divinity.",
  "Arthur tried to frame all this as a test of faith, and declared that those who we lost raising Agnes had been found wanting in their devotion to the Lightless Flame.",
  "She was just a brat.",
  "We were right on that front, though if we had known exactly how powerful the Web was in that place, perhaps we would have reconsidered.",
  "Whatever the situation, whatever you did, we were left paralyzed. Unable to go any further with our destiny, and, I was assured, unable to remove the impediment.",
  "So we waited. Agnes had reached adulthood but would age no further, so there was no worry to that. Her fire would someday die, of course, but until then it would neither fade nor dim.",
  "We did what we could. We found her a place to live, gave her Jude for a guardian, and provided for her material needs. And the years began to... slowly burn away.",
  "I took foreign workers, mostly, those with the fewest connections to complicate matters, and the most hopeful dreams of what their life might be. They were the ones that provided Agnes the most satisfying nourishment.",
  "I would wait for them to be alone, and then I would catch them unawares. Melting their mouth shut was a simple matter, and the screams they were able to make with their throat alone were easily drowned out by the constantly roaring machinery.",
  "I don't think I would have minded that, actually. At least I felt useful.",
  "Aside from that, Agnes simply waited. We all did, but I think it was the hardest on her. So much fire and destruction trapped raging inside her as she simply sat, placid, waiting for... something.",
  "Just not the one any of us expected.",
  "When she told us --  I have known anguish and destruction like few in this world, but the memory of that night still makes me shudder. The sadness and the grief that we felt at what we knew we had lost.",
  "Not immediately, likely not even within my remaining lifetime, but sooner than if she burned. And so we hanged her, as she requested. All because of that most insidious of emotions: Hope.",
  "We have allowed Jude free rein on what happens to the coffeeshop boy, though Agnes asked her not to interfere. She has not yet harmed him, but I cannot imagine what is going through her mind. The misery and pain he has brought upon himself.",
  "For all her anger, she is not rash. And I fear her quiet consideration far more than I worry about her temper. It may be he lives the remainder of his natural life, but she will make sure he is never happy, and never without pain.",
  "I hope, when it is time, we may burn you forever, Gertrude.",
  "Statement ends.  Nice to see Gertrude also used to get a lot of threats. So far, it doesn't seem that any of them went desperately well, except for Elias, of course, but he didn't threaten, did he, just -- did it.",
  "I'm curious to see what it was she did to derail this big ritual, because I'm sure she didn't pay poor Jack Barnabas to fall in love with Agnes.  Well, ninety percent sure.",
  "The others are doing... better, I think. Basira's busy doing research for something secretive, *unsurprisingly*, but she seems to be adjusting, to, uh... the new Daisy.",
  "I actually like Daisy now, which is a... really weird feeling. Melanie's quiet, but I think therapy's helping. Haven't seen Helen much. The door is -- sometimes there, sometimes not. I haven't knocked. I'm never going to trust it. Trust -- her.",
  "Trust it. And I shouldn't. Whatever its relationship to the person who was or is Helen, assuming that I can ever know its motivations is a mistake. And that just leaves Martin, which...",
  "I'm just worried about Martin.  Christ.  Every other Avatar gets to have their feelings burned right out of them, but me? I've just got to sit in mine.",
  "I know he said he had everything under control.  I *need* to trust him. Whatever he's doing with Peter, he's --  He knows what he's doing. Probably. I just -- I need him to be okay; I just do.",
  "If I -- *knew* what his plan was, if I knew what Peter was doing, if I just --  Can I?",
  "End recording."

  "[He sighs.]",
  "[The low rumble of the Archivist's static begins to sound in the background. The Archivist makes a few sounds of effort, which begin to grow both louder and more ragged.]",
  "[Then the high-pitched static that resembles microphone static layers itself on top with its strange, musical, near-angelic quality, and it becomes clear that the Archivist is putting a lot of effort into this Beholding, and that, as in \"Heavy Goods,\" it is not clear how much of this he is in control of.]",
  "[He continues to struggle through the process, and as he does, the distinct squeaky static of Peter Lukas begins to fade in as well.]",
  "[There's a sound that's difficult to place, could possibly be some things knocked off of the Archivist's desk, but which could also be the sound of a door opening. The Archivist groans.]",
  "[Then all at once, the static all fades out; the Archivist begins to regain his breath.]",
  "[TAPE CLICKS OFF.]"
