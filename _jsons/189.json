 "MARTIN": [
  "This is it, then.",
  "Don't play dumb.",
  "It's the final battle, right?",
  "We climb the tower, take out the bad guy, figure out how to change the world back, and back in time for tea.",
  "They did roll out the red carpet, didn't they?",
  "Must be nice getting the star treatment.",
  "What would you call it?",
  "Wow, you're *really* determined not to engage aren't you?",
  "The great Archivist, master of all he surveys can't handle a bit of public attention?",
  "[Sarcastic] Oh, I'm so sorry John, I didn't realise.",
  "God forbid you get *uncomfortable*.",
  "I guess I'll just tell everyone it's off then, shall I?",
  "We'll just go.",
  "You're right, I'm sorry.",
  "If it's any consolation, I'm scared too.",
  "I don't follow?",
  "But you're with The Eye too, though, right?",
  "So, maybe it's making you stronger as well.",
  "Use your words.",
  "Well yeah, obviously.",
  "Don't talk like that, okay, we can take him!",
  "So what, it's just a, an eldritch popularity contest?",
  "[Searchingly] Maybe it hasn't realised?",
  "[Spluttering a bit] Well, hang on, hang on, okay, let's think about this a moment.",
  "You're making a load of assumptions here.",
  "You can't see inside, remember?",
  "We have no idea what's happening up there.",
  "[Frustrated] Yeah, but that was always going to be the case, wasn't it?",
  "Wait, where are you going?",
  "Oh, yeah, sure!",
  "We should just go with one of all those other options that we have hidden up our sleeves, yeah?",
  "[Growing angry] No, d-d-don't \"Martin\" me, okay!",
  "We're here because it's this or nothing, right?",
  "And we can't *do* nothing, right?",
  "So, lead on.",
  "Where's the door.",
  "How do we get inside this monstrosity?",
  "You don't know?",
  "Something's probably blocking you.",
  "[Harshly] For god's sake John!",
  "[More calmly] I get it.",
  "Maybe there's another way in?",
  "What's this thing made of anyway, like, like, obsidian or something, right?",
  "Of course it is.",
  "Well, if it's just glass, then it won't be hard to break, right?",
  "We can just grab something heavy, like one of these cameras, and then all I need.",
  "[More calmly] I'll do a lap of the base.",
  "See if I can find any way in through any of the bits that used to be the Institute.",
  "Don't worry about me.",
  "Besides if anything happens.",
  "at least there's plenty of witnesses.",
  "Be back soon.",
  "[Brightly] All good?",
  "No, nothing's up.",
  "Everything is still awful.",
  "really happy to see you.",
  "[Loudly] Ah well!",
  "Looks like we aren't getting in here!",
  "Best head off then, eh?",
  "[Hissed whisper] It's fine, just trust me.",
  "Not sure how much everything up there actually understood what was going on.",
  "But, y'know, I didn't want to take any chances so it made sense to.",
  "Yeah, basically, more or less.",
  "Yeah, if something messes with his connection, he can get a little.",
  "Friendly faces have been kind of rare.",
  "How did you know we were there?",
  "Well, I vote we catch up somewhere that's maybe not quite so close to the sinister mega-tower.",
  "Oh, uh, er, Melanie, do you need a hand or."

 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "This is what?",
  "We've certainly got the audience for it.",
  "I'd hardly call flooding Oxford Street with blood, the \"star treatment\".",
  "A very lazy metaphor.",
  "I'm just nervous.",
  "Jonah Magnus is waiting at the top of this tower, and he obviously knows we're coming.",
  "And not only that, every eye in an entire city *made of nothing but eyes* is staring at me while I try to prepare.",
  "Well, clearly not.",
  "I'm more comfortable actually *doing* the looking.",
  "You don't need to be sarcastic, okay?",
  "That's what concerns me.",
  "What if *our* fear is feeding him?",
  "Making him stronger?",
  "[Softly] No, you're.",
  "Of course you're right.",
  "I can't believe I didn't consider it before.",
  "Me vs Elias, Jonah.",
  "We both draw power from The Eye.",
  "No, Martin, listen, what I'm saying is that whichever way you cut it, ultimately it just comes down to who The Eye *chooses*.",
  "Except one of the contestants is *also* planning to try and murder the judge.",
  "I don't see any way I can win this.",
  "Not now, not like this.",
  "You're right, meaning we have no idea what he's got planned for us.",
  "We shouldn't have come.",
  "I'm, I'm not sure.",
  "Maybe The Eye doesn't actually want me in there.",
  "Or, or it's something Jonah Magnus put in place, or.",
  "Or maybe I can't bring myself to look.",
  "Maybe I don't actually want to go inside.",
  "One-way mirrored glass.",
  "Oh, I wouldn't.",
  "[Softly] Warned you.",
  "just give me.",
  "Let me try to focus, tune out all these watchers.",
  "I-I've got a statement to make anyway.",
  "There's a lot here, Martin.",
  "Just be careful, okay?",
  "That's not funny.",
  "Right, here's your bloody performance.",
  "The minister hurries onwards, his eyes downcast, focusing on anything that breaks the monotony of the street.",
  "Cracks in the paving stones, boot-stomped cigarette ends, the mouldering yellow lines that snake along the pavement's edge.",
  "Anything so that he doesn't have to meet their gaze.",
  "The gaunt and hollow-cheeked figures that stare at him from every corner of this blighted city that might hide them from the chill.",
  "Stick-brittle women, dresses covered in second-hand blood; old men bloated from what we sold to them as food, skin discoloured from malnourishment; and the children.",
  "God, the children.",
  "They won't stop looking, won't stop following him with their piteous, desperate gaze that speaks so loudly his knees feel like they will buckle.",
  "Of course he will.",
  "He wants to.",
  "He hasn't lied to them, he really hasn't.",
  "He used to be one of them, he remembers what it can be like.",
  "He is there to speak for them.",
  "And if necessary, he will join them again.",
  "The minister grips his black leather briefcase closely to his chest, bile rising in his throat at the sudden jolt of fear that races through his veins.",
  "Where did that come from?",
  "Is he afraid of it, returning, of that sharp stab of hunger, the shivering of a cold you can't escape?",
  "Or is he afraid that should it come to that, they will see him as a deceiver?",
  "But he cannot dwell solely on his worries, he tells himself -- a sentiment that his journey is proving quite inaccurate.",
  "He glances at his watch, trying to hide it from his observers so that they might not see how expensive it is.",
  "He's late, of course.",
  "The minister is always late.",
  "There are never any taxis, you see.",
  "If he was in a car, it would be alright.",
  "Then he wouldn't have to see them, be seen by them.",
  "No, that's not the way to look at it.",
  "These are his people, it's important he stays connected to them.",
  "So why does it make him so afraid?",
  "Before him rises the great shining glass palace, jagged and angular, clear crystal fogged and smeared with sweat and grease and breathy condensation, but still its denizens can be seen by the masses of the starving that crowd around the edges.",
  "They cannot help but look inside, begging and weeping and hissing and falling as they wait for somebody, anybody, to stop the things that kill them.",
  "The minister uses the back entrance; the stale and humid air hits him immediately, the light from the not-a-sun reflected through a dozen layers of glass.",
  "The light takes on a crimson tinge as he passes an office dried with gore, and turns away from a back room where three men in fine suits laugh among themselves as they weave their pile of nooses.",
  "Time was, the minister thinks, they'd have at least put up a curtain, a token effort to hide their intentions.",
  "But now they work in full view, unafraid of what the masses outside may see.",
  "Their lies are just as transparent; there is no choice here but to believe.",
  "Finally, he reaches the chamber, the heart of the wretched place.",
  "Though the corridors are hard to navigate in this place of clear walls, you can always follow the sound of blustered roaring, echoing down the way.",
  "It gets louder and louder with each step, until the minister crosses the threshold into the great room, and it swallows him whole.",
  "The two sides scream and hoot and holler at each other, each on their end of the pit of sand, the arena in which they fight.",
  "The minister ignores the cobwebs in it as he makes his way to his chair.",
  "It is politer not to mention the thick layer of dust that has accumulated on the arena floor.",
  "He takes his place, marvelling again at how comfortable the seat is, how well it seems to fit, before the memory of the eyes outside, the knowledge that he can still be seen, wipes the contented smile from his face with a jerk.",
  "He looks across the divide at his opponents: pale and gurning things that smirk and guffaw and howl.",
  "They are content and safe and happy in this place, and only scream so loud from sheer hatred of the idea that any might make noise except themselves.",
  "On their thighs can be seen the glint of gold from the great polished nails they have driven through their legs and into the chairs, gangrenous wounds that ensure they shall never have to rise again, their position utterly secure.",
  "On his side of the arena the shouts should be sharper, more angry, but their tone and pitch are such as to merge seamlessly with the others.",
  "There are no golden stakes on this side pinning down his would-be comrades.",
  "But the minister must be careful not to look too closely, or else he might see how many of his allies are fused to their own chairs, on which they have sat comfortable for so long.",
  "His eyes drift away, through the walls to the crowd outside.",
  "Their baying cries for justice cannot be heard in here.",
  "If any whisper should make it through, it is utterly destroyed in the deafening shouting that surrounds him.",
  "But he cannot forget their eyes, watching him, piercing him with their wounded humanity.",
  "The minister swallows, and tries to speak over the din.",
  "At first his words are lost, vanishing into the cacophony without a ripple, but they are words, clear and distinct from the shapeless expostulation of his peers.",
  "And as he says them, one by one the others fall silent, their disgusted attention landing on him until his own voice falters in the sudden quiet.",
  "Across the pit the pallid things gurn at him in indignant curiosity, while on his side he is surrounded by expressions of horrified betrayal.",
  "They can all hear him now.",
  "Any words he speaks will ring out through the chamber.",
  "He wants to talk of the people outside, the bruised and abandoned ones that suffer and die to slake their appetites.",
  "He wants to cry for restitution, for justice, for a future, for anything.",
  "But all eyes are on him and he falters.",
  "He remembers the cold, the hunger, the ache of concrete beneath him.",
  "He is afraid.",
  "And his chair is so very comfortable.",
  "The minister coughs, once, uncomfortably, and sits down.",
  "As he does so the great bell tolls for dinner, and a thousand scuttering servants swarm out and into the chamber, depositing their silver trays before each seat, piled high with succulent, steaming meat.",
  "The minister eats as those outside look on, and all he tastes is salt.",
  "Left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.",
  "Wh-- Something's up.",
  "Why are you smiling?",
  "What's going on?",
  "Put on a show?",
  "[Archly] I am not going to collapse.",
  "What do you mean again?",
  "[Brokenly] I do not -- I'm just feeling a little bit woozy alright?",
  "I ca-can't quite think straight.",
  "Like at, um.",
  "um, Martin, you remember?",
  "I don't like being discussed like I'm not here.",
  "not what I was expecting.",
  "Okay, this is, uh.",
  "this is a-a lot.",
  "Why don't we take it from the top?",
  "I'm really glad.",
  "H-How are you here?",
  "What, what happened?",
  "I'm sorry to cause a fuss.",
  "So, what's next?",

  "Oh come on.",
  "You do it all the time.",

  "It's fine, Georgie.",
  "You can use the \"c\" word.",
  "It's *extremely* weird.",
  "I keep telling her that technically there's no proof of that.",
  "Georgie's got that fearless thing going on, and me and The Eye, well, you remember our messy divorce.",
  "There was nowhere to go back to, so I told her about the tunnels.",
  "Turns out, not only were they still here, they actually do a decent job of hiding things.",
  "When you aren't painting a huge target on our backs.",
  "I'm here, aren't I?",
  "I didn't say anything about being nice about it.",
  "let me moan.",
  "[Snorts] Bit late for that.",
  "[Sarcastically] Everyone is *so* excited to see the Ceaseless Watcher's special little boy.",

  "No, I'm fine.",
