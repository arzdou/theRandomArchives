  "Was it blank or.",
  "He's never going to speak to us again.",
  "You don't think he's going to.",
  "Look, I know you don't like him.",
  "But I'm not going to help you get him fired.",
  "Isn't that a little.",
  "You're sure you don't just want to stay?",
  "So you really think the Institute is, what, haunted?",
  "Oh no nonononono!",
  "It kinda looked.",
  "It did, though, didn't it?",
  "No, no, it wasn't.",
  "It went into the tunnels.",
  "We can't just leave him.",
  "We need to hurry.",
  "I didn't hear anything.",
  "Why, do you think it was the Sasha-thing?",
  "No, I know, but I mean.",
  "like, if you really stretched her out.",
  "So go get some help.",
  "I thought you said he was a waste of a suit.",
  "If you want to go, I understand.",
  "You were all about quitting.",
  "It never is.",
  "I don't know.",
  "I don't know!",
  "I want to find out what's going on.",

  "No, no it's not \"fine\".",
  "You've been going on and on and on about how alone you feel because John's not taking your feelings into account while he's having his breakdown, but you're just doing the same thing.",

  "I don't know.",

  "And I don't mean like 'sneaking a cigarette' bad.",
  "Like properly bad.",
  "We need to stop him.",
  "Because something tells me we're going to need evidence by the end of today.",
  "I don't want to wind up in court without something to back me up.",
  "Er, tribunal if we're lucky, inquest if we're not.",
  "Yeah, I took one off the pile.",
  "It was blank.",
  "Don't get my hopes up.",
  "Aaaaaand he's gone.",
  "I don't know, Martin!",

  "If he hasn't already.",
  "Got that, did you?",
  "What do you think is happening here?",
  "This isn't office politics.",
  "It's not like he's had one too many at the Christmas party and started ranting about the Greeks.",
  "Whatever is happening here it's literally supernatural.",
  "No, it isn't \"a little y'know\".",
  "There is something in this place, and it's messing up our heads.",
  "It watches us all the time.",
  "It stops me quitting.",
  "I'm pretty sure it would stop Elias firing John even if he decided to try actually running the place for once.",
  "I used to.",
  "Now I think it's worse.",
  "What the hell was that?",
  "What the hell was that?",
  "Oh don't say it.",

  "And she did.",
  "Yeah, we can.",

  "You've been under a lot of pressure.",
  "You should talk about it.",
  "Have a real good chat.",

  "I hated it.",
  "Let me tell you a story.",
  "You like stories; we can even call it a statement if you want.",
  "Once upon a time there was a monster, but no one realised.",
  "Sometimes someone did and then they were scared, so that was good.",
  "But one day a nasty man came along.",
  "A nasty man who tricked the monster and wrapped it all in webs and tied it to a table.",
  "So the monster got its friends to carry the table all around, and it still got to take faces and scare people.",
  "Then one day it was sent to the house of its enemy, which had the biggest eyes you ever did see.",
  "The monster was sent there to steal all its secrets, but it was sad because it couldn't scare anyone any more.",
  "Then finally, after what seemed like forever, a stupid, arrogant, little man cut the webs and set the monster free.",
  "Free to kill and scare whoever it wanted.",
  "So thank you.",
  "I did leave what clues I could but I never dared hope you would actually release me.",
  "I must confess, though, I almost enjoyed watching you scurry around.",
  "Desperately missing the point.",
  "At least I knew what I was looking for.",
  "You really aren't even a shadow of your predecessor.",
  "Even I would make a better Archivist than you.",
  "Maybe I will.",
  "You'll miss the Unknowing, of course, but you wouldn't understand it anyway.",
  "I wonder, if I wear you, will I really become the Archivist?",
  "Rob the eye of its pupil?",

  "I'm hardly surprised, must be its idea of a joke.",
  "Still, it is.",
  "it is a head start I suppose.",
  "I have no idea where in the tunnels I am.",
  "Or how far down.",
  "At least it didn't leave me trapped in some corridor hellmaze.",
  "a different corridor hellmaze, at least.",
  "So I suppose I just.",
  "I just wait for now.",
  "I don't think it's going to just give up, and I can't risk attracting its attention.",
  "It might already be down here with me.",
  "Just stay quiet.",
  "God, I'm an idiot.",
  "Smash the table, kill the monster, stupid!",
  "Lazy, sloppy assumption.",
  "Of course the table was binding it.",
  "The table is webs and spiders.",
  "Spiders are something else.",
  "They don't help each other, they oppose, they.",
