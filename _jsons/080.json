  "Please! I don't know how much time we have.",
  "Is that necessary? You think I pose a danger to you?",
  "Then take it with you, but I can't afford to just sit here.",
  "Could we at least have this conversation in the tunnels?",
  "Unlikely. Whether something like that can actually be destroyed... It is trapped. I, I hope for a very long time.",
  "Was that her name? I'm afraid she's gone. Whatever it does to those it takes, they don't come back. She's dead.",
  "Do you need a moment?",
  "You're quite like her, you know. I suppose that's no surprise. Anyway, your questions?",
  "I said reading. It doesn't need to be spoken aloud.",
  "The upper levels, yes. Made them more rational, actually. It didn't strike you as odd that you were able to map them in a matter of weeks?",
  "No. I thought I was being very careful cleaning up after myself, but you have keener eyes than I gave you credit for. I should have expected that, I suppose.",
  "The arrow, however, was not mine. The 'Not-Sasha' had come down several times. I suspect it was almost as curious about me as you were.",
  "Hardly a book. Barely twelve pages. It is entitled A Disappearance. If read cover to cover, it removes one from the world. I cannot say precisely what that means, only that the assistant I assigned to it, Jacob Feng, was never seen again.",
  "I have found, however, that reading only one or two words is sufficient to hide me from the prying eyes of your master. It allowed me to talk with Gertrude in relative safety, and occasionally come above ground for my own ends.",
  "Hard to say. I've been in hiding for over twenty years now, ever since my library was destroyed.",
  "I don't follow.",
  "That is hardly my point.",
  "My name has become a curse.",
  "I was born the heir to great wealth. My family used to deal in manufacture: steel, textiles, all sorts. But, by my time, it was largely a matter of extensive property holdings and carefully managed investments. Money making money.",
  "About which part?",
  "I've spent twenty years trying to learn from my mistakes.",
  "When I started working with Gertrude, she hunted down some editions I thought might help.",
  "Of course. Three of them, each meeting an unpleasant end. So, when she found me, it seemed natural that we help each other. In this instance, that meant finding certain useful books.",
  "[Sighing] I'd hoped you would at least know that much by now. But I suppose you are simply the observer, and making these connections is not your role. Gertrude could be much the same at times.",
  "Yes, that's actually rather good.",
  "Yes. It seems to have a particular fondness for them.",
  "Well, do so quickly. We've wasted enough time on your questions.",
  "No. Don't be absurd.",
  "This is a distraction! You're in no danger --",
  "I believe it was Elias.",
  "I assume he discovered we were planning to destroy the Archives.",
  "This is why I need those files. I searched this place thoroughly, and they're not here, so I assume Elias took them when he killed her. I need your help to get into his office.",
  "Simple mechanical eyes? In his place of power? You think he can't control everything they see? Assuming such interference wouldn't ruin them beyond recovery, of course.",
  "You know the answer to that.",
  "I have also heard it called Beholding.",
  "You belong to it, too.",
  "We don't have time for you to have a breakdown, Archivist.",
  "I'm not sure you would have liked him, you know. He's paranoid enough. But I don't think he's got the stomach for it.",
  "No. No, I didn't have time.",
  "How did you know I was here?",
  "[Begging] Elias, please!",
  "The files. The ones you took from Gertrude.",
  "It's not just the Institute and you know it. They had everything she had found on the Stranger.",
  "You of all people should want to stop them.",
  "And what's he going to think when he gets back?",
  "He might die.",
  "Elias, it doesn't have to be like --"

 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "So you said.",
  "Yes. Yes I do.",
  "So talk fast.",
  "I'm not going back down there. That thing... Is it dead?",
  "And Sasha... The real one?",
  "No. No, I'm... You're not what I expected.",
  "You first. You want my help, you answer my questions. Agreed?",
  "Statement of Jurgen Leitner. February 16th, 2017. Statement begins.",
  "Right. Let's start with what you did down there. How you... trapped it.",
  "I didn't hear you say anything down there.",
  "Right. So you can change the tunnels?",
  "You moved the tunnels for me?",
  "I thought I was just getting a sense of the place. I suppose you left the rubbish around for me as well, giving me hints? And the arrow?",
  "And the other book?",
  "My master? We'll get to that. How long have you been down there?",
  "[chuckling slightly] That'll be our Gerard.",
  "I wouldn't worry about him. He passed away a couple of years ago.",
  "So are you to blame?",
  "For the books. Or did you just stick your name on them by accident? Why the 'Library of Jurgen Leitner'?",
  "Tell me from the beginning.",
  "Huh. You're right.",
  "You were a fool.",
  "Why didn't you burn them?",
  "But you didn't know any of this when you had almost a thousand of them in your care?",
  "You said you didn't take any of them with you, so where did you get these?",
  "And why was Gertrude helping you?",
  "I... I didn't know Gertrude had assistants.",
  "Like The Key of Solomon?",
  "You keep talking about these... powers? These forces arrayed against you. What are they?",
  "Just tell me!",
  "Are you... are you trying to tell me all of this is at the behest of... evil gods?",
  "So the creatures are, what, priests? These books, their holy texts?",
  "So the books, the monsters, they're part of these beings? Just extensions of them? Fingers being pushed into our world?",
  "Like a... a, a muscle, spasming on reflex?",
  "It would explain Michael's identity issues.",
  "What about bones? Does one of them manifest with, with bones?",
  "I'm sorry, this is a lot to take in.",
  "Fine. Then I'll make this one simple: did you kill Gertrude?",
  "Then who did?",
  "Gertrude was going to destroy the Archives?",
  "But the cameras? They showed him.",
  "This place belongs to one of them, doesn't it?",
  "I... Uh... I... I think I need some air.",
  "I'm going to have a cigarette. Don't...",
  "Sorry, I've been quit for five years now, but th--",
  "Oh god... I need to... Uh... I need to, um... [trails off almost incoherently]"

 "ELIAS": [
  "Well. This is a surprise.",
  "Reach for a book and I will kill you.",
  "How much have you told him?",
  "I've wondered for so long who it could be down there. Who was helping her. I honestly never would have guessed.",
  "What did you want from him?",
  "Planning a little light arson, are we, Jurgen?",
  "I know. It's, um... what do they call it?",
  "[Chuckles] Creativity never was their forte.",
  "And we will. But I don't think we'll need your help.",
  "Well, he was always going to need to fly the nest at some point. Go out and see the world for himself.",
  "It's always a danger. Almost always."

 "TIM": [
  "I think it's working again.",
  "...yeah, yeah it's recording.",
  "Yes. Because the tape works now.",
  "I don't know. And I don't care.",
  "Because this is us now. Worms. Monsters. Corridors. They'll keep happening until one of them kills us, and we've just got to deal with it.",
  "Any sign of the woman?",
  "Look. There's no point talking about it. It happened. I hope it doesn't happen again. Statement fucking ends.",
  "It's been days. At least.",
  "It's probably already killed him.",
  "Try his office.",
  "I told you he was going to do something like this.",
  "I told you."

 "MARTIN": [
  "Tim, where were we?",
  "Forget the bloody tapes, Tim! Are we sure this is... this is here?",
  "How long was it?",
  "Sorry? Sorry, what? How can you not care!?",
  "I don't think so. We should have helped her.",
  "But we could have tried!",
  "We... we should look for John. Maybe we can still help.",
  "We can't just sit here moping!",
  "Don't joke about that, okay?",
  "Oh. Oh no.",
  "Oh, no, no... Who is it?",
  "Oh John... What have you done?",
