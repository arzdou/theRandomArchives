  "You, you've sent *plenty* of people our way.",
  "S-sorry,  I'm still not *entirely* clear what's going on.",
  "What *are* you doing here?",
  "I, I mean, sort of.",
  "So -- so, what, he sends you to answer questions because he doesn't want to?",
  "And you *do* it?",
  "is there a limit?",
  "okay, okay then, sure, sure.",
  "First question, then.",
  "Why are you helping Peter?",
  "Don't you serve different, you know, fears?",
  "And being aware of how lonely you are  can make anywhere feel more empty.",
  "How are new powers born?",
  "How soon could it attempt this ritual?",
  "How do we stop it?",
  "Could you at least *try?",
  "And *how close is it,* do you think?",
  "You don't sound worried.",
  "Sounds like a rich feeding ground.",
  "And let me guess: you think he can't see *the big picture.",
  "-- I -- I don't know, that space station.",
  "So why didn't it work?",
  "I don't see your point.",
  "Assuming the Extinction doesn't derail everything.",
  "It doesn't *scare* you.",
  "I think our experience of the universe has value.",
  "Even if it disappears forever.",
  "So what do you *do,* then, if -- if the world is pointless, and your god is so weak right now?",
  "I thought *you* said that the maths doesn't work.",
  "You make it sound like the -- the entities don't even know what they're doing.",
  "You can't be *serious!",
  "Yes, yes, I think I get it.",
  "What about the monsters?",
  "Things like Mi-- erm, uh, the Distortion.",
  "I thought they were part of the entities themselves -- like, extensions.",
  "Surely *they* know what's going on.",
  "So -- so, if no one's ever actually communicated with their patron, how do you know they even want rituals?",
  "How -- h-how does anyone know if they could ever even work?",
  "Who are you?",
  "No, no -- who *were* you?",
  "And -- and how did you get started with it all?",
  "Did you -- did -- did you just look up at the sky one day and fall head-over-heels in love?",
  "Er -- I'm sorry?",
  "It does seem like it.",
  "Sit back down.",
  "You said you were here to answer my questions for Peter, but so far you've told me basically *nothing* of any use.",
  "Then let's try some smaller ones.",
  "Is Peter attempting a ritual?",
  "How honest has he been with me?",
  "Protecting the others.",
  "But -- but that was never the endgame, was it?",
  "He just wanted me on his side long enough to rope me into his, his plans for the Extinction.",
  "So, why *me?",
  "* What's his plan?",
  "Why not get the others involved?",
  "And he needs me to use it.",
  "They need to serve the Lonely.",
  "How do *you* feel about this?",
  "All of it.",

  "You don't think it'll be the end of the world?",
  "actually been quite helpful.",

  "It's none of your business.",
  "You know about that?",
  "Well, there you go, then!",
  "I didn't know John had listened to them already.",
  "Look, I don't have time for this.",
  "I don't *like* that I have to work with Peter any more than you do, and I didn't *know* that Simon was involved until today.",
  "But I would *hope* that you and John understood the importance of preventing an apocalypse.",
  "Yeah, well, that's *your* problem.",
  "* Peter's the one with the plan, and.",
  "it needs me to be alone.",
  "Of *course* I do, but it -- might be the only way, and.",
  "so far at least he's been honest with me.",
  "I need to do this.",
  "I'll do what I have to.",

 "SIMON": [
  "As in, all those people who said I did horrible things to them and their loved ones?",
  "They *have* been in, haven't they?",
  "Shall we get started?",
  "I suppose it was a bit much to expect him to have filled you in on everything already.",
  "I mean -- in many ways -- that's the point.",
  "You've been working with Peter for a while now, correct?",
  "And he's been promising you answers to all those -- difficult questions?",
  "Well, that's me.",
  "Yes, well, you have to understand how it is with Peter.",
  "He finds talking to people *directly* very difficult.",
  "Especially explaining the more, um -- *esoteric* side of things?",
  "Charming chap, I'm sure you agree -- *absolutely lovely* -- but even if you *can* convince him to *actually* give you a straight answer, he's just not that good at actually putting these things into words.",
  "Something to do with his upbringing, I think.",
  "I'm pretty sure he was home-schooled, you know!",
  "Is that your first question?",
  "Only until I get bored.",
  "And that does tend to come more quickly these days.",
  "See, that's actually *two* questions.",
  "The answer to the first is simple.",
  "I lost a bet, and this is how the good Captain chooses to use that.",
  "The second is.",
  "I mean -- yes, if you want to get technical, he serves the One Alone and I serve the Falling Titan, but those two are a lot closer than you might imagine.",
  "After all, the larger the space you find yourself alone in, the more isolated you feel.",
  "I've actually been toying with the idea of trying to do something with the scale of humanity itself -- you know, emphasize all that overpopulation nonsense -- but honestly, it just doesn't ring true for me.",
  "We're all just so tiny and pointless, you see, it's hard to really get past it.",
  "Also, I worry it might be straying into territory that emboldens our potential new rival.",
  "The very same.",
  "Peter said you'd have a lot of questions about that one.",
  "Can't help you.",
  "No, no, no, you're right, of course.",
  "The thing you have to remember is that no one actually knows how these things work -- not *really.",
  "There's always been plenty of theories, of course, and over a century or two you do start to get an intuitive feel for it, but.",
  "there's really no hard-and-fast *rules.",
  "The powers, or entities, or fears, or whatever you want to call them, are bound up in emotion.",
  "How they exist, what they can do, how they interact with the world.",
  "it all makes about as much logical sense as a nightmare.",
  "Which is to say, there is a certain sort of emotional logic to it all: things *feel* like they flow together in a way that makes sense, but if you try to stop and do the maths, then it all comes apart.",
  "At least, in my experience.",
  "*When* is a new power born?",
  "Well, when does it *feel* like its birth would be right?",
  "When enough creatures suffer a terror of it that *feels* distinct, that *feels* truly its own?",
  "Then it would probably feel right for it to emerge into its own.",
  "Or perhaps there's a ritual.",
  "If it *feels* right to enact some sort of birthing ceremony, some.",
  "Hard to be sure.",
  "Peter thinks very close indeed, what with all the current hubbub, and I'm inclined to agree.",
  "That's because we disagree on exactly how bad it will be.",
  "Peter seems convinced that the Extinction is different, that its actual birth will be as bad -- or worse -- as another power fully manifesting.",
  "He believes its advent will be heralded by all sorts of disasters, and catastrophes, and global upheavals, and whatnot.",
  "That kind of thing.",
  "Peter, however, seems to think that it will upset the balance that we all have an awful lot invested in.",
  "And he's not at all certain the world as we understand will come out the other side.",
  "I see why he likes you.",
  "It's all a matter of perspective, you see.",
  "My patron has gifted me with, quite frankly, an absurdly long life.",
  "An appropriate gift, and one that serves to provide a certain distance from things.",
  "Of course, a paltry few centuries is nothing, really, but it's more than most get.",
  "And even in that brief time, I've seen all sorts of ebbs and flows to the balance of things.",
  "Do you know when the last ritual I attempted was?",
  "Oh, goodness, no, that's the future, my boy!",
  "It was 1853!",
  "The height of the aquarium mania!",
  "All over the empire, people were starting to understand the depths of the terrible unknown below the ocean.",
  "And I thought that was a rich vein to be tapped.",
  "Even bothered old Halley[^1] into helping me design a special diving bell for the ritual.",
  "I called it the Awful Deep, and between you and me, I was rather proud of myself.",
  "[^1]: Edmond Halley again?",
  "Because it wasn't a very good idea.",
  "The fear wasn't out there -- not like I hoped it was.",
  "It all sort of.",
  "Also, a Hunter broke in and destroyed the mechanism.",
  "Sent me and all my sacrifices plummeting to the bottom of the ocean.",
  "My point is.",
  "you know, I've quite forgotten!",
  "Hey, I've just not been doing much recently.",
  "It's not a good time for perspective, you see.",
  "The world all feels too small these days.",
  "I used to do a lot with religion, but it's just not got the same conceptual scope as it used to.",
  "Honestly, I'm pinning most of my long-term hopes on space.",
  "But that's at least a hundred years away.",
  "Which is why I'm happy helping Peter.",
  "But, if it does, then I'll either be dead, which will be fine, or.",
  "* Taken on a cosmic scale, we've never even been alive -- not in any way that might register.",
  "I mean, if this dreadful little planet had a fractionally different orbit, and life had never even started here, then ultimately nothing of any real importance would have changed.",
  "What a lonely way to look at things.",
  "Which makes sense, I suppose.",
  "*I* have a good time.",
  "And do my best to avoid the drama.",
  "It's all been getting a bit much over the last few decades.",
  "I blame the number of people.",
  "From a raw numbers point of view, it's getting very busy.",
  "More minds equals more fear, after all.",
  "Oh, you *are* a quick one!",
  "So, maybe I'm wrong!",
  "But, crucially, I suspect a lot of the other servants and creatures out there have a similar idea.",
  "Probably why they're all in such a rush to make their own attempts.",
  "I have no idea if they're \"doing\" anything at all.",
  "If they're even capable of \"doing\" things.",
  "I know that most of their servants are simply doing their best to interpret and serve something that is almost definitively inconceivable.",
  "Let's try one of those analogies Peter finds so annoying.",
  "imagine you are deaf.",
  "But every night you hear the most beautiful music in your dreams, and your every waking thought is consumed by trying to reproduce that music.",
  "-- oh, you're mute, as well, in this analogy, or at least, you can't sing.",
  "And you need to invent the idea of a musical instrument from scratch.",
  "Yes, well the point is: most of us are trying so desperately to recreate our own dream symphony that we bring an awful lot of our own baggage into the mix.",
  "Honestly, I think they have it a lot worse than we do.",
  "Imagine being a hand that can conceive of itself -- having impulses shot through you, being moved and clinched by some unseen mind -- but never knowing the reasoning behind your own actions.",
  "Or even if you're just some thoughtless reflex.",
  "The idea that this is all some grand cosmic joke -- thousands of us running around spreading horror and sabotaging each other pointlessly, while these impossible, unknowable things just lurk out there, feeding off the misery we cause?",
  "I find that interpretation *quite appealing.",
  "But, I still hear the music in my dreams.",
  "No one you would have heard of.",
  "No great historical figure or atrocity-monger.",
  "I've been Simon Fairchild about, um, eighty or ninety years, maybe?",
  "For business purposes, mainly.",
  "By which I mean I was bored at not being wealthy, so I made some arrangements and sent Mr. Fairchild on a very long fall.",
  "I could go into details, but without a certain amount of knowledge of 1930s tax practices, it wouldn't mean very much to you.",
  "Sort of, actually.",
  "Except it wasn't the actual sky, it was a painting.",
  "I was apprenticed, you see, under Tintoretto.",
  "Dreadful man, but a decent artist.",
  "He was fascinated, you see, with the human figure.",
  "He found most of the rest of the work dreadfully dull, so he'd always delegate a lot of it to us.",
  "He had a particular distaste for painting the sky, and I was always the one he called on to do them.",
  "Days, weeks I would spend, focusing so intently on these patches of clear sky or swirling cloud at the top of his latest self-proclaimed masterpiece.",
  "And gradually it sort of, um, drew me in, until it seemed to dwarf the rest of the work.",
  "Every stroke of the brush felt larger than my entire existence.",
  "And when I finally lost my footing, well.",
  "I should, of course, have fallen to the floor of the church, broken my neck.",
  "But that blue-painted sky welcomed me with open arms.",
  "And I never looked back.",
  "I try to share it with others -- not just as sacrifices -- but they often find it difficult to keep up with the, um.",
  "*velocity* I tend to live at.",
  "They tend to get left behind, and I suppose it doesn't help that I can't bring myself to see any of them as anything other than trivial.",
  "No wonder I'm so sympathetic to the Lonely!",
  "You know, this really is a place for self-discovery, isn't it?",
  "Statement ends, I suppose.",
  "Oh, nothing, just my own hubris.",
  "I should have known.",
  "When I came here, I said to myself, \"Simon,\" I said, \"You're going to answer this young man's questions, but you're not going to give the Watcher a statement.",
  "You're better than that\".",
  "But it's a hard one to resist, isn't it?",
  "You get in the flow of talking about yourself, and it all just.",
  "Well, this *has* been fun.",
  "I like it.",
  "The big answers are rarely helpful.",
  "Not in the sense that you're used to.",
  "Him and his family made their play a few years ago, and they failed.",
  "I'm sure he'd like me to explain it, but I think he can do that one himself.",
  "About which part?",
  "I think he tried.",
  "I suspect he may have slightly exaggerated his abilities when you first made the deal, but he certainly expended a reasonable amount of influence and resources to follow through.",
  "Do you really need me to answer that one?",
  "He is what he is, Martin.",
  "For a creature of the Lonely, the urge is always to isolate, never to communicate or connect.",
  "I suspect that's why he's so keen on wagers.",
  "It allows him a framework for cooperation that doesn't risk any sort of intimacy.",
  "As for his plan.",
  "I don't know the details!",
  "But I believe there is something in the Institute that he thinks can help his cause.",
  "From what he said, it must be powerfully aligned to the Watcher.",
  "If he wishes to use it, it would need someone already touched by the Eye.",
  "You might need to be a *tad* more specific.",
  "I think Peter is taking a rather large but calculated gamble.",
  "Not just on you, but on a lot of things.",
  "If it works, he'll be in a very strong position.",
  "And if he fails, it won't be all that bad.",
  "Oh, it very well *might* be, but.",
  "life has continued through dozens of apocalypses already.",
  "Ice ages, pandemics, calamities, extinctions.",
  "The only reason this one feels special is because, well -- it's happening to you.",
  "And that's the sort of solipsism that tends to come with loneliness, in my experience.",
  "So, my feeling is that I'll help out where I can, but ultimately, if this Armageddon comes off, then -- so be it.",
  "Either billions suffer and life goes on, or billions suffer and life doesn't.",
  "In the grand scheme of things, it's all much of a muchness.",
  "I get that a lot.",
  "I'd say, \"any time,\" but honestly, if you see me again.",
  "I may just throw you off something for a joke.",
  "How do you feel about -- roller coasters?",
  "You're no fun."
