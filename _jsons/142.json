  "Yeah, but who does.",
  "We don't all get to build Formula 1 engines.",
  "Look, it's fine.",

  "The point is that I, I work underground.",
  "*Did* some work underground.",
  "Look, I know -- I know this doesn't have anything to do with -- just --  About five years ago, we were doin' some work under Kentish Town.",
  "It was pretty nasty.",
  "Do you know what a fatberg is?",
  "No -- uh -- it -- Don't worry; *Don't* look it up -- Seriously, *don't.",

  "Or, or wet sand.",
  "It felt like -- rough and, and, like the fingers weren't -- I don't know, they felt like they weren't in the right places?",
  "And then I started thinking, and -- I realized something -- the way, it was, it was grabbing me, holding my leg, there was --  It *had* to have been coming upwards.",
  "From *below* me.",
  "And there was no one else down there when that tunnel collapsed.",
  "Absolutely no one.",
  "I start screaming again.",
  "And kicking, thrashing about.",
  "It hurts, but -- I mean, I'm scared out of my mind, but th-the hand, it just grips, tighter, and I can feel its f,fingernails, just -- I,It -- It started *pulling.",
  "Just like that, it was -- gone.",
  "But the bruise stuck around.",
  "Horrid, muddy bruises where the fingers had grabbed me.",
  "It-It took a long time to get over that.",
  "I mean -- That's not weird, right?",
  "I mean, it was a bad time, you know -- it stays with you.",
  "I signed off, what, probably about six months, with the injuries?",
  "I had really bad, uh, nightmares.",
  "Claustrophobia, I mean, obviously, right?",
  "But, uh, but I did my physio, you know, talked wi -- with the counselor they gave me.",
  "Look, I did everything I was supposed to, and, and yeah, I -- I guess I was fine.",
  "You know, once the bruises were gone -- well, I mean, it's easy to blame memory, right?",
  "You know, hallucination, all the -- classic shite you tell yourself.",
  "Look, life went back to normal, I -- I was fine.",
  "Until -- about two weeks ago.",
  "That's when he showed up.",
  "Uh -- You know the coffeeshop, uh, just next to [Pinnacle]?",
  "Uh, th-the nice one.",
  "Well, I actually had -- had a date there, you know, cute guy I met online, too sporty, which, [joke] I like, look, it -- it doesn't matter; Anyway -- I get a latte, and, and sit down, waiting for, uh -- Grant?",
  "I want to say Grant.",
  "Anyways, look, he's running late, and, and I'm just reading, and there is this.",
  "*creep* in the corner- your guy.",
  "keeps staring at me, like- oh, *properly* staring, like it is *super* intense.",
  "And, and real.",

  "I -- *I* try to ignore him, look, I just -- I just read my book.",
  "And everytime I look up -- there he is.",
  "You know, I'm about to say something, you know, like wh --  When in comes Gary -- Gareth -- Gavin -- and suddenly, hey!",
  "It's a date.",
  "And I really didn't want his first impression of me to be, you know, me yelling at some creeper in the corner, so I just.",
  "swapped chairs, so that I've got my back to your.",
  "*colleague*, and get on with it.",
  "It didn't really matter, you know, in the end; Gareth was, uh, was a bust, you know; not like -- you know.",
  "He -- he was fine, I guess, but it's just nothing really there between us, you know -- just a nice boring coffee with a kind old man.",
  "Took about an hour, and he clearly wasn't feeling it either, so we, you know, we just called it.",
  "I mean, I think we actually shook hands, when he left, which, I mean, tells you something, right?",
  "So, look, I'm packing up, all done, and, and I just -- I just sort of turn, you know?",
  "Just to check if he's still there -- and he is standing *right* behind me.",
  "Like, like a few *inches* from my face?",
  "Look, it's *messed* up!",
  "And I start to ask him, you know, *what the* *hell,* man, you know, like -?",
  "But he just starts talking.",
  "But real intense.",
  "He says he works here, at the -- the Magnus Institution, and I say what even is that, and he says *he wants my story.",
  "He says he *needs* to hear what happened to me, and I -- I want to tell him to, to go away; I, I wanted to, to *kick* him and run.",
  "But -- I --  I sit down.",
  "And I start to tell him -- everything.",
  "About the job, about the collapse, a-about the hand -- And more than I told you, even, and as I do, it -- it's like I'm there again.",
  "Like I can *feel it* grab my ankle, I, a,a cold, dead hand, and I just can't stop talking, like I cannot shut up.",
  "No, I'm not!",
  "Of course I'm not -- It felt like -- Like I was throwing up all those feelings again, and I wanted to, to scream, but instead I just *sat* and calmly told him my life story, and he just *watched* me.",
  "His eyes, like -- His eyes were li-like *drinking in* every fragment of *my* misery.",
  "I *can't* -- It --  And then it was over.",
  "And he looked -- He looked at me like he'd just eaten, like, a *perfectly* cooked steak.",
  "You know what he said, he said *\"Thank you\".",
  "* Thank you, just like that, like -- like reliving the worst parts of my whole life were just a bit of a favor that I'd done him.",
  "And then he left, and, and I-I just sat there, and cried for a while.",
  "That wasn't the end.",
  "Not -- But kinda.",
  "I *feel* like I do.",
  "I've been -- *dreaming* of that tunnel again.",
  "Oh, god -- awful nightmares.",
  "Nightmares, where the, where the hand keeps pulling, and I go deeper and deeper and, and deeper into --  It takes me places I do *not* want to go.",
  "And he's there the whole time, just.",
  "Watching me *scream* and *thrash* and --  He's *all eyes.",
  "* He's all eyes.",
  "I know that's not --  That is *my* brain.",
  "I'm not blaming him for, for being in my dreams.",
  "You know, I guess I can't.",
  "That's absurd, right?",
  "It's no -- But I feel like I'm seeing him when I'm awake, as well?",
  "I've been- I've been having a lot of problems, since he talked to me -- well, since *I* talked to him.",
  "Since I told my story.",
  "It's back, you know, worse than it ever was, and I can't do my job.",
  "I have these, these *screaming* panic attacks every time I try, and -- and what am I supposed to do?",
  "Can't even go into a shop basement anymore without feeling that -- hand.",
  "Every time I do, every time I get that -- panic just rising up my throat, I see him.",
  "Not when I look properly.",
  "But just at the edge.",
  "The corner of my eye.",
  "And he's got -- well, maybe, maybe it's just me; maybe I just -- I met him once, in a coffeeshop, and he was a creep, and it messed me up.",
  "But that's enough.",
  "That is enough.",
  "So,  So I want to put in a complaint, like, like a *proper* complaint.",
  "Look, I don't want to go to the police.",
  "I mean, I doubt they would -- They wouldn't even, you know, let me get this far, now would they, but --  Sorry.",
  "So, thanks, I guess.",
  "Just -- I just -- I don't know- Y-You know, *talk* to him, I guess?",
  "Just tell him, like, like I mean that -- it's *not okay.",
  "*  Well -- Y-- I just, I don't want to see him again.",
  "That's it -- That's -- my -- complaint!",
  "I, I -- I can't.",
