  "I'm just trying to figure out if there was a reason she gave you to me.",
  "The way she was smiling.",
  "as if she was handing over a secret.",
  "When she killed you, there were plenty of outstanding cases and such, but nothing that would still be relevant.",
  "Well, you were working on quite a few statements when she killed you.",

  "God, I was a mess.",
  "I mean, part of me kind of suspected she'd killed before, but clearly she hadn't done it enough to be a decent hand at chopping up and dumping bodies.",
  "She was having a real hard time of it.",
  "My legs were all over the shop.",
  "Would probably have been funny, if it hadn't been me.",
  "I don't know how to describe it.",

  "Never listened to me, obviously, but  nothing new there.",
  "You got *old.",
  "To be honest, I'm impressed, more than anything.",
  "Hard to get old in this business.",
  "You either die, or you, uh, stay young.",
  "How did Mary look?",

  "Have you seen my son?",
  "not as reassuring as you think it is.",
  "Why did she give me to you?",
  "* You know what that means, don't you?",
  "Oh, just thinking.",
  "Five years as her husband, god knows how many as her possession, and she just couldn't stand being bound in the same book as me.",
  "Yeah, it doesn't feel great.",
  "But being dead, I s'pose you don't feel things quite as strongly.",
  "Little bit -- flat.",
  "I'm aware of the heartbreak, but I don't know if I actually feel it.",
  "It's strange, really.",
  "So what now?",
  "Yes, I think that would be for the best.",
  "I don't know.",
  "Do you have any questions?",
  "Any unfinished business?",
  "Sorry, what do you mean?",
  "Gertrude, I left the Archives months before she killed me.",
  "They didn't tell you.",
  "Why would they?",

  "How is he, by the way?",
  "* Elias Bouchard, seriously?",
  "I figured out how.",
  "Well, that's it, isn't it?",
  "I suppose that's why she gave me to you.",
  "One final *screw you* to the Eye.",
  "I just --  I don't mean to be a *dick*, but -- well, it's been a long time since I've had any sort of -- leverage, I guess?",
  "Just a -- little bit of power.",
  "It's kind of nice.",
  "Thinking about it.",
  "You know, you were never actually all that nice to me when I worked for you, Gertrude.",

  "What, you gonna threaten me?",
  "Look at me.",
  "Best I can currently hope for is to be burnt to ash.",
  "I'm going to tell you, just -- maybe there's a price?",
  "I don't know -- I haven't had a chance to think.",
  "I want two things.",

  "Oh, sentimental as ever.",
  "I want to make my statement.",
  "I don't want to disappear on *her* terms.",
  "I want to speak my piece, have it recorded.",
  "Me, Mary, and the Archives.",
  "I'm almost not sure where to start, now it comes to it.",
  "I always loved ghosts.",
  "They fascinated me.",
  "Not the rattling chains and horror part of it, of course, but the mystery, the promise of secret knowledge, of seeing something that no one else was privy to.",
  "A secret world that gripped my imagination.",
  "So when I finished my Masters in library science and saw a vacancy at the Magnus Institute, of all places, I jumped at the chance.",
  "The chance to pursue my passion and my career at the same time seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up!",
  "It was only an assistant archivist position, of course, but that was fine.",
  "A good entry position -- I'd, I'd soon move on, I told myself.",
  "And for the first few years, it was pretty much exactly the job I'd expected.",
  "Longer hours than I'd hoped, and the Archivist seemed less interested in doing her job than I was, but all told there were worse places to work.",
  "Then I met *Mary.",
  "* She was like no one I'd met before in my life.",
  "She was *beautiful,* like a -- like a shark is beautiful.",
  "Every moment she made was deliberate, sharp, and her eyes were always focused on something, always watching.",
  "And when she looked at me, I always felt afraid.",
  "But there was something else.",
  "Something *under* the fear.",
  "Something that made me feel very aware of all my blood.",
  "I don't know what she saw in me, not really.",
  "But when she walked up to me and told me that I was taking her to dinner, I couldn't help but nod.",
  "I've always been --  Well, now, I wouldn't call myself a *coward,* but I've never been in a fight.",
  "Never even been punched.",
  "Maybe it's -- luck.",
  "Maybe it's the fact that I can never really bring myself to push back from people.",
  "And Mary pushed *so hard.",
  "* Harder, even, than you.",
  "And I let her, because she gave me something I had never before experienced: Danger.",
  "The things she taught me, had me do -- I'd never known anything like it.",
  "Whenever I kissed her, it tasted like *blood.",
  "I knew what she was, I, I think.",
  "What she was capable of.",
  "But I convinced myself that I was safe, that she loved me.",
  "It made me feel special.",
  "That I was somehow protected from all the cold cruelty that she tried to keep hidden, but leaked out in so many ways.",
  "I remember visiting her, shortly after she'd started her books business.",
  "I found her sitting opposite a corpse, a well-dressed middle-aged man who sat in a huge armchair she kept in the back office.",
  "She looked me in the eye and told me he was her uncle, prone to drink, making an unexpected visit, and had passed out in the chair.",
  "I knew she didn't have an uncle.",
  "I knew the man was dead.",
  "She didn't lie to me because she expected me to believe her; she lied to me because she expected me to obey her.",
  "And I did.",
  "We rescheduled our date to the following day.",
  "But d'you know what the strange thing is?",
  "Despite the violence, death, even my own murder, I still don't feel like she.",
  "She was what she was.",
  "And I knew that.",
  "And even though I told myself that she would never harm *me* -- of course not!",
  "I was her husband, her true love -- even then, the only one lying was me.",
  "She never promised anything, not even in her vows.",
  "She never betrayed me.",
  "Not like you.",
  "She never played dumb when I was stalked by bloated, blood-soaked things, or told me I was imagining it when your friend Adelard dropped a screaming box into the Thames.",
  "She didn't try to keep me in the dark just so I wouldn't stop being useful; she never made me complicit in a thousand different nightmares, and lives ruined for the sick joy of some otherworldly voyeur.",
  "Compared to that, I suppose a few murders were easier to stomach.",
  "But I couldn't be part of it.",
  "Not once Mary told me what was really going on.",
  "I know what you say, what you *think* you're doing, saving the world one poor doomed soul at a time -- I mean, I understand; I do.",
  "But I couldn't be a part of it.",
  "Not when I saw what happened to everyone else you involved.",
  "I had to get out, to escape this place.",
  "I had a *son* to look after; he needed me!",
  "Or so I thought.",
  "And that's when *you* turned nasty, isn't it?",
  "When all your resources, they no longer want to serve your purpose.",
  "I suppose you didn't know there was a way out, a way to escape.",
  "But if you had, would you have told me?",
  "Mary, at least, played straight with me.",
  "She knew all about the Institute.",
  "And when we were married, when she was sure I could handle it, she laid it all out for me: the rituals, the Powers, all the messy little cogs of the games you play with the universe.",
  "She laid out her own plans as well, her dreams of power.",
  "In many ways, I suppose they were no better than yours.",
  "But at least *she* didn't bother to hide behind noble aims.",
  "Maybe that's why I chose her, in the end.",
  "At least she was *honest.",
  "*  Or perhaps I actually was afraid.",
  "Terrified of the crossroads where I'd found myself, and I chose the option I thought might keep Gerry safe.",
  "At least if I was home *with* him, I could perhaps soften the edges of his mother.",
  "I suppose I never really understood.",
  "No matter how clear the situation was, how well it was explained to me, I just couldn't see the parts of it that I didn't want to.",
  "Two years, I tried to figure out how to quit, how to leave this place.",
  "And when I finally did, when I felt the Watcher's grip slip away, it left me in such a state I was no longer useful to Mary, and.",
  "she did what Mary does.",
  "It was fitting, I suppose.",
  "Even after everything, she made me taste blood one last time.",
  "I just --  I thought it would be more of a relief.",
  "It was actually really simple.",
  "Not easy, but simple.",
  "You'll kick yourself when I tell you.",
  "You were almost there, you know, with your theory that James could watch us from any eye, even an illustration.",
  "What did *you* do?",
  "How did *you* sever that link?",
  "I left to avoid dragging my family, my son into this life, to *try* to look after him.",
  "But Mary decided that a newly blinded husband was simply too much of a burden.",
  "Just as long as they're useless.",
  "I went the extra mile, destroyed them completely, but -- I'm sure you'll find something  neater.",
  "A strong acid, precisely applied?",
  "That sounds more your style, *if* you decide to do it, that is.",
  "It's not an easy sacrifice to make, is it?",
  "Don't you always.",
  "It's the only way.",
  "Trust me, I tried them all.",
  "So, was there anything else?",
  "Then if you don't mind?",
  "I think I'd like to go away now.",
  "If it doesn't, I'm sure you'll figure something out.",
  "If you see Mary again, tell her --  No.",
  "I guess there's not really anything else to say."
