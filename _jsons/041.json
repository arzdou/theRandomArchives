  "Statement of Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, regarding exploration of the tunnels recently discovered below the archive. Statement given direct, 2nd September, 2016. Statement, uh... Statement begins.",
  "I have been exploring the tunnels.",
  "Well, I had my doubts how effective a knife would be, but it certainly eased my mind. Beyond that, I made sure to take one of the smaller CO2 fire extinguishers from the Archives. I was determined that any surviving worms would not be so for long.",
  "It was spoken simply, without intonation or threat. Just a command.",
  "I don't care about the tunnels, or the secrets they might hide."
