 "OPERATOR": [
  "999, what's your emergency?"
 ],
 "ELIAS": [
  "Yes, I'm calling to report a crime in progress.",
  "Ah, y-yes, not immediately, but I will be shortly.",
  "Could I speak to your Chief Inspector, please? Tell her Elias Bouchard is calling. Of the Magnus Institute.",
  "Ah, yes, er, good afternoon. Er, sorry to bother you. I believe you're looking for Detective Alice Tonner?",
  "I do, yes. Er, she should be here in about fifteen minutes.",
  "That would be wonderful. Much appreciated.",
  "Statement of Barnabas Bennett, as given in a short letter to Jonah Magnus. April 9th, 1824.",
  "My dear Jonah,",
  "Let me tell you, Jonah, I believed myself profoundly lucky that day as my hansom deposited me on the steps of my townhouse, a mood only slightly shaken by the impression that, as the cab pulled away, it seemed to have no driver that I could discern.",
  "Please, Jonah, if you have any compassion within your heart, you will not leave me in this place.",
  "Your loyal servant,",
  "That's what this place is, John, never forget it. You may believe yourself to have friends, to have confidantes, but in the end, all they are is something for you to watch, to know, and ultimately to discard. *This,* at least, Gertrude understood.",
  "Let us begin.",
  "Goodness, John. Whatever happened to your hand? And your neck?",
  "You look a mess.",
  "Martin, would you be so good as to fetch Melanie and Tim. I think it would be worth their time to be here.",
  "No need, Basira. I've already got one running.",
  "Now, you have something to ask me?",
  "That's... That's quite nice, actually. Tingly... but sort of freeing. [Chuckle] You know, even Gertrude never properly tried to compel me. I always wondered --",
  "Oh, no need to worry about that. I just feel it's only fair to wait for your colleagues, John. They'll want to hear this too. Uh, it's also very important to me, in a personal capacity, that you understand I'm answering you of my own free will.",
  "I know, but I do. There's so much of this place, of ourselves, twisted by forces far beyond us. I just wanted you to know --",
  "Yes, I was just saying to John. It's very important to me you understand that no action I have taken has been controlled. I have done everything because I wished to.",
  "He's right, Martin. The thing you remember as Sasha was nothing like her. It toyed with your memory. If I showed you a picture of the real Sasha now, you'd have no idea who it was.",
  "Precisely. It finally tried to kill John. Then Leitner killed it. Then I killed Leitner. And I believe that brings us up to date. More or less.",
  "What about him? An irritant. Interfering because he's bored, and he resents us. He has no purpose --",
  "Ah, yes, thank you Rosie. Er, could you ask them to wait a minute or two?",
  "There. That should make it even easier for you. Right, Detective? I know you were planning to kill me, but surely an arrest is a consolation prize?",
  "Oh, didn't she tell you why she hadn't gone back to the station?",
  "Allow me. She rightly suspected that I held evidence of various murders she had committed, and that I sent this to her superiors.",
  "And anyone close enough to be implicated. They will kill Basira.",
  "If the officers down there take you away...",
  "Oh, but perhaps I was wrong when I called them. Maybe it was a false alarm.",
  "A contract of employment. For Basira.",
  "Sign it, and I'll send your ex-colleagues on their way.",
  "False alarm, Rosie. Could you apologise to the officers for me, and thank them for their time.",
  "Ah, of course. Er, sometimes I forget how new you all are to this.",
  "Basira is now tied to the Institute. All of you are. Like fingers on a hand. And I am the beating heart of it. Should I, or the Institute, be destroyed, you will all, unfortunately, follow suit.",
  "And it would not be a pleasant death.",
  "Then shoot me. Just squeeze the trigger, and watch the only person you care about die screaming. Your last connection to humanity.",
  "The police are not the only ones who can find a use for your violence. I'm sure there'll be plenty here for you to do. Feel free to go where you like in the meantime. I'll be in touch.",
  "Now that's taken care of, if you'll all give me and John a moment alone. I'm sure we have some things to discuss.",
  "Come on, John, there's really no need for the scowl.",
  "Honestly? To offer some congratulations. You're doing a lot better than I expected.",
  "And believe me, that is a remarkably rare skill.",
  "The easily-digestible sort that wipe away any doubt and fear, and neatly organise your new world into happy little columns? No. Not from me.",
  "These are things you must discover on your own.",
  "[Sighs] What are you?",
  "Precisely. It is your job to chronicle these things, to *experience* them, whether first-hand or through the eyes of others. To simply be told, well...",
  "Our master, John.",
  "You were doing fine before you forced this little scene. I suggest you continue.",
  "A little bit of direction never hurt anybody. So to speak.",
  "The Unknowing. I need you to stop it.",
  "A ritual. The Stranger and its kin attempting to gather power enough to bring it closer.",
  "Not exactly. These things that touch us, they... don't have a form of the sort that could exist in physical reality. So the Stranger wishes to remake that physical reality into something closer to itself. It wants to make this world its own.",
  "*That* is what you need to find out.",
  "Hardly effortlessly, but I take your point.",
  "I could. But I believe that if I did so, you would fail. The Stranger is antithetical to us.",
  "We thrive on ceaseless watching, on knowing too much. What we face is the hidden, the uncanny, and the unknown. If you are to stop them, you need to get better at seeing. And my explaining things is simply not enough.",
  "John, even when you had them all at your disposal, you barely got through one statement a week. Why do you think that is? It takes its toll on you. And I *know* you've had problems with moderation.",
  "For now. I'll be in touch.",
  "John, what does human even mean? I mean, *really?* You still bleed, you can still die. And your will is still your own, mostly. That's more than can be said for a lot of the 'real' humans out there.",
  "You're worried about ending up like that thing, lurking in the dirt under the streets of Alexandria? Don't be. Just do what you need to, and you'll be fine. Understood?",
  "Good. Well, I have work to be getting on with. I'll send you a Return to Work form, but don't worry about the doctor's note. Now, if there's nothing else?"

  "Uh, okay, okay, so I've got everyone, but I'm honestly kind of lost as to what's happening.",
  "Is, is that like, er...",
  "So-So-S-Sorry, that guy was Jurgen Leitner?",
  "And Sasha? Did you kill her too?",
  "[Splutters incomprehensibly] It wasn't... Sasha?",

  "Right. That's enough for me. Even got it on tape.",
  "Everyone get back.",
  "Out the way.",
  "Get out the way!",
  "Heh. So I kill you, and go to jail. I'll take that deal.",
  "Yeah. They would.",
  "I'm sorry, Basira.",
  "What do you want?",
  "So... what, you're her boss now? Is that supposed to stop me?",
  "What do you want?",
  "You piece of --"

 "BASIRA": [
  "Er, John? Do you... You want to get this on tape?",
  "Go for it.",
  "Just answer the question.",
  "Daisy, where do I know that name from?",

  "Oh damn it.",
  "What do you want?",
  "Feels like all I've managed to do is... not die.",

  "It doesn't please your master?",

  "[Chuckles] Directed towards what?",
  "Again with -- What is \"the Unknowing?\" Exactly.",
  "They're trying to, what, summon it?",
  "And how do I stop it?",
  "No. You are not doing that. I know you have Gertrude's notes, her, her files. She was working on a way to stop this. Not to mention that apparently you can... effortlessly see anything at any time!",
  "So you obviously know how to stop it. You *could* just tell me!",
  "And you can't just give me all of the statements?",
  "So it's... it's back to breadcrumbs, and statements, and risking my life talking to things that barely remember how to be human anymore?",
  "Am I... Elias, am I still human?",
  "I suppose so."
