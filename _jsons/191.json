  "Sorry, I -- It's fine.",
  "I was just startled.",
  "You were sleeping with your eyes open again.",
  "J-just took me by surprise.",
  "No, I, I know.",
  "Is there any other kind?",
  "Speaking of, how are your dreams?",
  "I know they used to be.",
  "So, like, standby mode then?",
  "Oh, you'd just completely conk out.",
  "-- you'd just be dead to the world.",
  "I actually got a bit worried, once or twice, but you always woke up fine.",
  "You said you didn't dream.",
  "Sounded pretty happy about it too.",
  "Hey, I meant to ask.",
  "Do you recognise that woman, Celia?",
  "I'd swear she gave a statement once.",
  "I thought she was making stuff up!",
  "I gave her some money.",
  "I mean, she doesn't seem to remember her own name, so I'm guessing.",
  "Well, no, that'd just be weird.",
  "Don't think we've met.",
  "I'm Martin, this is John.",
  "And you are.",
  "As in your name's No?",
  "Do you know when they'll be back?",
  "What's in the 'tins'?",
  "[Irritated] What food?",
  "Well, I could probably go for a..",
  "Do you need to make a statement?",
  "Well, it's good to hear.",
  "I'll see what I can find.",
  "Lead the way.",
  "Oh, s-sorry, I-I didn't catch you name.",
  "Hi Arun, what's up?",
  "Yeah, it wasn't on when you found it, right?",
  "Kind of, I guess?",
  "They follow us around a bit.",
  "Oh, y-you don't need to worry.",
  "It's been happening for ages.",
  "Before the world changed, even.",
  "You can just ignore them.",
  "it's kind of a long story.",
  "Ask the prophets, if you want, they'll explain.",
  "knew them in the old days.",
  "Yeah, I, I realise that.",
  "Look, it's complicated, okay?",
  "It's just a big pile of stuff that no-one understands.",
  "Look, you, you should really talk to them about it, okay, I don't want to say the wrong thing.",
  "Ooh, I'm not sure.",
  "It's different, alright?",
  "your truth is rude!",
  "You don't know anything about us.",
  "Who we are, what we're doing.",
  "That's not true.",
  "[Agitated] We're here to save the world, okay?",
  "If you want more than that, go ask your prophets, okay?",
  "Give me that!",
  "No, but the others say it's pretty normal for them to be gone this long.",
  "That said, the, uh, 'locals' are getting restless.",
  "I get the impression our welcome isn't exactly unconditional.",
  "How's the, uh, fuzziness?",
  "Yeah, you don't seem as bad as you were at Salesa's.",
  "Hopefully you won't forget everything as soon as you leave the tunnels.",
  "You don't remember.",
  "I mean, they've got to, right?",
  "You-You're basically humanity's only hope.",
  "That's probably a bit too much pressure, yeah?",
  "I-I just meant that, look, either they help or they just sit down here and hope it all magically works itself out.",
  "And they can't really think that's an option.",
  "And you're sure we can't find the way up on our own?",
  "The Eye isn't, like, calling you, or something?",
  "We might have to just try anyway.",
  "Yeah, Laverne mentioned.",
  "Do you know what they are?",
  "that's a blast from the past.",
  "Uhhh, I think so?",
  "Uh, World War Two, right?",
  "When we defeat The Eye, the fears.",
  "What happens to you?",
  "But I assume that's the best case scenario?",
  "I love you, John.",
  "But I'm not going to doom the world over it.",
  "And you have to promise me you're going to do everything in your power to live.",
  "God, I hate these conversations.",

  "[Muzzily] Mm, what?",

  "I can only do it when I'm disconnected from.",
  "well everything, and it's more like.",
  "You know that feeling when you're right on the edge of falling asleep?",
  "Not quite dreaming, but not aware of stuff either?",
  "[Soft laugh] I suppose.",
  "What was I like at Salesa's?",
  "I imagine I was.",
  "no, I, I don't think so.",
  "Wh-- Not down here at least.",
  "Do you think she remembers?",
  "You could ask?",
  "No, it's fine, we were up.",
  "Is that so?",
  "That's not how it works!",
  "She's talking complete rubbish!",
  "But I've seen it!",
  "I *know* it.",
  "I didn't mean to upset you.",
  "Georgie and Melanie, are they.",
  "Of course they do.",
  "Any chance you could bring me something back?",
  "I'm feeling a little shaky.",
  "I haven't since we got down here.",
  "I suppose it must be the tunnels.",
  "Nice to be a bit more in control, although it does feel.",
  "Any sign of them?",
  "Comes and goes.",
  "I don't *think* I will.",
  "It was worse there, though, obviously.",

  "So, what do you think?",
  "You reckon they're going to help?",
  "Huh, I mean.",
  "I don't know.",
  "I know how Georgie gets about people in her care.",
  "If she thinks helping us will endanger them.",
  "I'm cut off down here, and the layout seems.",
  "different to before.",
  "Oh, no it is.",
  "But I can't get a clear reading on it down here.",
  "It's kind of maddening, actually.",
  "Like being on a street you almost remember but can't find on a map.",
  "Yeah, but without a guide we could be wandering a long time.",
  "And apparently there are things wandering about there as well that.",
  "might put up some resistance.",
  "Did you ever listen to Gertrude's interview with, uh, Sergeant Heller?",
  "I'm not the first Archivist.",
  "Not by a long way.",
  "Most of the others died like Gertrude, but some.",
  "lingered, and, well, let's just say I'm not the only one that feels the Panopticon calling.",
  "I think it depends on what actually happens.",
  "If we figure out a way to defeat them, banish them somehow, kick them out of our reality, and back to where they came from, I might.",
  "I think I'd stay more or less like this.",
  "W-Weaker, but fundamentally still an avatar in a world where the fears are once again lurking on the edges.",
  "Depends on your point of view, I suppose.",
  "In the long term all we'd have done is bought some more time.",
  "If, however, we find a way to somehow destroy or, uh, eliminate the powers.",
  "I'm not going to be okay.",
  "There's too much of me that's part of The Eye now.",
  "know what would be left of me without it.",
  "Maybe I just die.",
  "Maybe I survive, but I lose.",
  "I don't know.",
  "Martin, when the time comes, I need you to promise me that you won't try to stop me.",
  "I love you too.",
  "We could talk about the weather for a bit I-if you like?",

  "You can hide all you want, but if they know your name, they can see you.",

  "Then they come for all of us.",

  "There's nothing natural about this though.",
  "We could still pull him out, y'know, like, like the others.",

  "You know you're not actually a prophet, hon?",

  "Even if it feels like it sometimes.",
  "We'd better still be talking about the Admiral.",

  "I know that, right!",

  "But if there's even a small chance we could put things back.",

  "A-A-At least now it's on our terms.",
  "This way you can get back to podcasting about monsters, rather than hiding from them.",
  "Oh god, yeah!",

  "It hurts to see him like that, but he's safer there.",
  "If we took him, we'd just be putting him in danger.",
  "We might even be putting the others in danger from him.",
