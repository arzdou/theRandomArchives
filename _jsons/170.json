  "Oh! Hello.  ...What are you? Do I -- Do I know you?  Can't --",
  "Can't tell through the -- fog, sometimes. You feel -- n,not friendly. Familiar?",
  "Shape of you in my hand. I talk to you, don't I? We talk. What do we -- do we say?  *Can't quite --*",
  "Th-There's something there, but I just can't see it.",
  "Anyway.  Ni-Nice to sit down. Take a load off.",
  "Not a comfortable chair, of course. No-None of them are, here. I've -- I've been all over this house looking for a nice place to sit.  I -- think.",
  "Is that what I was looking for?  Um. Ei-Either way, this place is so huge... so... empty, by the time you find your way to anything at all, you've probably earned a sit-down.",
  "I don't think there's anyone else here, I --",
  "Pro-Probably never has been. Not that I can remember, at least.",
  "Is it my house?",
  "It must be, right? It must be, 'cause -- why else would I be here?",
  "You don't just wander around other people's houses alone; you don't just...",
  "You don't just... just wander.  *No...*",
  "What, what was I saying? I don't...",
  "Do *you* remember? You store them, I suppose. Keep, keep stuff locked up in those little wheels. That's memory, isn't it?  Computers used to be like you. Big, whirring things with loads of -- uh, tape. They called that memory.",
  "But it's not -- not, not really; it's just numbers and...",
  "Maybe you're blank as well, same as me.",
  "Are you? Can you remember what I've already said, --  -- cause I -- I, I can't; the words keep creeping away? Like -- like, like when I try to think back, to focus -- um, focus on -- um --",
  "Oh, oh! Oh. Hello! What are you; I can't quite -- see. You feel -- familiar. Do I know you, do we talk?",
  "I hope so.  It's good to talk with people. It's -- hm.",
  "Oh, I, I met someone; did I tell you?  He's -- I, I don't know. I like him. He doesn't like me, though. Not really. I don't blame him.",
  "I don't like me sometimes, and I *am* me. Plus he's -- he's my, my boss? Is that right?",
  "Ei, Ei,Either way, it's probably for the best. Wouldn't really be appropriate. You don't need to worry; I'm not doodling his name on my desk or anything.  His uh -- his -- his, um. His... name...",
  "Wait, what *is* his name?  I don't --  *Why, wha-- Why can't I remember his name?*",
  "His, his face, I don't --",
  "Wh-Where am I? This, This isn't my house!",
  "I don't like it here. I can't see anything with all this --",
  "This fog; this -- this is nothing out the windows, and it's, it's so cold.",
  "The fireplace is dead and the curtains... there are mirrors but no...",
  "No. Not mirrors.",
  "Someone's standing in them but I don't, I don't know who.",
  "That face, who is... who is that?  I need to sit down.",
  "Oh! Oh, hello.  Who are you, then?",
  "Hmm. Hm. Can't quite make out a -- A tape recorder?  Can't remember the last time I used a --",
  "Hm. Blast from the past! Familiar...",
  "Well, it's good to have someone to talk to. Otherwise you can go strange, you... I, I don't...",
  "Hm. What was I saying?",
  "This... this chair, --  -- really isn't comfortable. I had a look-round for better places to sit -- did I tell you that? -- but it's, it's big house.",
  "My house, I think.  Nowhere comfortable. So I suppose this is it.",
  "It *is* my house, isn't it? Must be. Must be.",
  "I don't really remember. Just... so tired. It's hard to think when you're this tired, hard to... to focus.",
  "No, no, no, no, not, not tiredness, just the -- fog. I -- can't see through the fog, and it -- it *smells*!",
  "What --  What *is* that? Damp, sort of -- chemical, almost.  I don't like it.",
  "Why does my house smell like that, I -- It can't be *my* house.",
  "No, no; people -- people don't smell like that. Besides, I'm all alone.",
  "I'm all --  I'm all alone.  Why -- Why am I alone? I, I shouldn't be alone; there should be people! It's such a -- such a big house, *my house* -- there mu-- there must be other people! People who care!",
  "I don't like it here.",
  "It -- It can't be cheap living here, house this big. I really need a job.",
  "Started lying on my CV; did I tell you that. I didn't want to. I-I mean I tried to be a good person, but we're really up against it, and I -- and I -- I know they're going to find me out; I just know it.",
  "No... No, no, no, that's not right! I-I'm not alone, no! Not alone, there's -- there's -- J-J-John? John.  John! John!",
  "John? John, I'm here; can you hear me? I can't -- it's -- it's this place, I -- wh-where are you; I need you, I nee--  -- I need you, John.",
  "Where -- Where did you go.",
  "Please don't leave me. I can't do this on my own. Please.  I'm not enough on my own.",
  "Alone.  All. All alone.",
  "Oh. Oh, hello. What's this?",
  "*Wow*, retro! What are you up to, little buddy; just -- listening?",
  "That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to.",
  "Maybe you can keep a better handle on things than me.",
  "It's this fog, you know? Makes it so hard to *see*.  WhatwasIsaying?  I feel like there's somewhere I need to *be*. But no, no; this is *my* house; where else would I need to be?",
  "I just --",
  "I wish I had comfortable chairs.  Would be nice to have somewhere relaxing to sit down. Rest a bit when Mum's asleep.",
  "Did I tell you about my mum?",
  "We should try to keep quiet actually, you know. Make sure not to wake her. The drugs -- they, they hit her pretty hard, but -- if you make enough noise and she wakes up, and --  and yeah, it's not good.  Not a good time!",
  "I-I *know* she loves me; I-I *know* she does.",
  "But that doesn't make it easy. There's always so much to do, and I'm *always* forgetting something.",
  "I do try, you know? I mean, I *really* try to keep on top of things, but I'm just -- I'm just so forgetful, and she -- she --",
  "Wait, her face, I -- I don't -- I don't remember her face.",
  "Did -- Did she have a face?  D-Don't -- Don't be stupid, Martin; of course she had a *face!*  You just can't remember it 'cause --  'Cause you're a *bad son*; because you left you left her to rot in --",
  "Wh-Where did she go?",
  "She didn't like it; *I* didn't like it. S-Smelled. It smelled like --",
  "Where am I? This isn't right; I shouldn't be here; I should be --",
  "Somewhere, someone that -- there, there are people who trust me, people who love me, so why can't I remember them? Why, why can't I see them?",
  "Sasha. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, I, I remember; there was -- there was Sasha! I can see her face!",
  "No -- no, wait, no; not, not Sasha, some -- something else. The thing that *isn't* Sasha, that, that took her, and, and made her -- something else, and her -- face, her -- her face, I can still see it; it's -- laughing.",
  "Oh, my heating bills must be through the roof, *stupid*; can't afford that!",
  "At least I've got a job now; did I tell you I've got a job? I mean, the interview was weird, I-I don't really remember the man who talked to me. Just his *eyes*.",
  "They stared at me. Th-Through me, and -- and I knew *he* knew what I had done.",
  "*God.* I was so *scared*, but then he smiled, and shook my hand.",
  "What was his *name?*",
  "He said I *'had the job,'*  that he *'looked forward to working with me.'*",
  "I was still so scared I could barely move my arm. I was so terrified I'd let him down.",
  "And then I met John, and I --  John -- John! John! John? John, I'm here! John, I-I think I'm lost, I think -- I don't --  *John.*",
  "Oh, he-hello! What are you?",
  "Huh. Didn't even know I had a tape recorder. Do you still work, or...",
  "Yeah, seems like you're running all right.  *Hey*, I should do some poetry! You could give it a little, little bit of that *funky* lo-fi goodness! All the cool poets love a bit of tape hiss, right?",
  "Maybe find somewhere different to sit, though.",
  "*Hate* these chairs. Don't even know where I *got* them.",
  "But -- the sort of weird you just have to *get out* somehow.",
  "Maybe I -- Maybe I should do some open mics, or something. Just for me, really, I think.",
  "Oh! You -- You want to hear some?",
  "Uh -- yeah! Yeah, okay, sure; well, I can -- No. No, wait, no that --  Hm, they're *gone*; that's weird. I thought -- I, I can feel them, but the words, they just -- just wash away.",
  "I, I m -- I suppose *that's* quite poetic actually, but --  Nothing else there.",
  "I don't like this place.  It's so cold, and, and the logs in the fireplace are damp from the mist. I don't know how I'd even *light* them, and they -- they smell really bad, like they're wet *dirt*.",
  "Makes me think of -- hm.",
  "When I was nine, my grandad died. Did I tell you that? I went to the funeral, and the coffin was so --  *shiny*. It was already sealed.",
  "But on top there was a photo of a -- young man. Someone who looked *almost* like my grandad, but -- it, it wasn't him. It wasn't... finished? Not yet.",
  "No, and -- and I suddenly began to panic, because I was trying to remember what he looked like, his, his face, but I couldn't do it. And I knew I'd never see him again.",
  "He loved me and I couldn't even remember his *face!*",
  "It was -- It was a horrid, drizzly morning, that day, and they put him in the ground and he -- he smelled like *earth*. Cold, damp soil.  What was I saying?",
  "Ah -- S, Sorry --  It's just this *chair*-",
  "-- it's so hard to concentrate when you're uncomfortable, isn't it?",
  "Now, I think -- Hey, hang on. Where did you come from?",
  "*Tape recorder*.  What, you want me to give you a statement, I --",
  "Why. The Eye has won. It can already see everything; it wouldn't *need* a -- w-wouldn't need a --",
  "Well it's just, nice to talk to someone, I guess. No one real ever really listens to me anyway.",
  "Oh, they nod and respond and say *'No, Martin,'* or *'Not now, Martin*,' or *'Leave it, Martin --'* but, funny thing is --  I didn't ask them to do anything!",
  "Just wanted to see if they needed a hand.  Is that me?  Is -- Is that me? Martin? Martin. *Maar*tin.   *Mar*tin.",
  "Doesn't sound right. But who else would I be?  Whoever owns this house, I guess. It certainly doesn't *seem* like the kind of place that somebody called *Maar*tin would live.",
  "It feels like a small name. One that wants to be warm and happy. Not like *here*.",
  "You know, I've wandered around *all* these rooms, and -- they all just make me feel alone.",
  "They scare me.",
  "Even when I find someone else, I feel alone. Did I tell you?",
  "I -- found someone else, wandering around. They were all -- thin and grey. Faded. Like they'd been here for ages. I think they'd been -- crying, but it's so hard to tell through the fog.",
  "I tried to talk to them, but it was just -- just *difficult*! I asked who they were, and they -- looked at me like they had no idea what I was talking about.",
  "\"What's your name?\" I said, \"Your name? You must have a *name!*\" but they just -- shrugged, and I -- and --  And they gestured at me. Like they wanted to know *my* name, and I -- th-- I couldn't tell them! I couldn't remember!",
  "\"Is this your house?\" I asked, and they said, they said yes. But -- then they stopped, and shook their head. And, and then they started to laugh.",
  "Quietly, for a bit, and then they cried. And they wouldn't stop. I -- I --",
  "They asked me who they were, if there was anyone looking for them. If there was anybody left who even cared, but I -- I didn't know. I, I didn't know, and I --",
  "I ran away -- I had to run away!  I, I had to go and have a sit-down, okay? I just --  I just wish I had thought to buy some nicer chairs.",
  "Still. Not like I've got guests coming, is it?  The house is empty, and, and honestly? I -- I can't think of anyone in the world who would care if I lived or died.",
  "I-I-I'm *scared*. I think this fog is doing something to me; I can't --  I'm losing myself, and I -- and I don't know if I mind?",
  "Maybe I deserve it.  So much of what's behind the fog hurts. So much of it just makes me wanna curl up with *pain* and *embarrassment* and --",
  "Maybe the fog's here because I want it here.",
  "Is that why I opened the windows?",
  "Maybe I asked the fog to come.  No. No, no -- no, no, no, that's not true, I -- I remember! Hundreds, thousands of lost souls, wandering the halls. Hollow memories, with eyes full of tears.",
  "I've seen them.  They're all trying to remember. T-To recall, to picture someone, *anyone* who loves them, and their hearts are all full of *fear*.",
  "Afraid that those people are gone forever. That maybe -- maybe they never existed at all.  Why am I *here?*",
  "I-I fell behind. I was -- I was too slow, and, and, and the fog caught up; I was following. Al-Always following, never leading. *Never* leading.",
  "Why did he leave me behind? D-Did he? Who are -- Wh-- Who *are* you? Who am --?  J-J-John.",
  "Talking helps. I got you all here to listen;  Just, just don't stop talking.",
  "Wai-- wh-- John?",
  "John! John, over here!",
  "I thought you'd left me behind. Gone on without me.",
  "John, it's -- okay. I promise, it's okay. This place tried; it *really* did, and honestly, I --  I wanted to believe it.",
  "But I didn't.",
  "N,No. It's comforting here, leaving all those -- painful memories behind, but --  It's not a good comfort, it's -- i,it's the kind that makes you fade, makes you dim and -- distant.",
  "It's the Lonely, John. It's me.",
  "No.  No, not anymore."
