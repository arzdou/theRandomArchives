  "John, wai-- Hey, just wait!",
  "W-Will you please talk to me?",
  "In the tunnels?",
  "Alright, we'll, we'll go back to the tunnels, regroup, figure out what our next move is. See what other options there are.",
  "\"Consider\" what exactly?",
  "Really? Then please enlighten me. Go on, I'm all ears!",
  "Oh yeah? But let me guess, it was made for you?",
  "[Petulantly] Of course it is. Of course it is! Because how could this journey possibly end with anything less than the final, supreme destiny of the Archivist, plugged into the great fear machine for all eternity and, and abandoning humanity.",
  "Breaking his promise.",
  "And how's that going to help? You've always said you can't make less fear in the world. You'd, you'd just be moving it around.",
  "And what? Replace them with new avatars from the people who don't want to?",
  "[Incredulous] Christ, can you hear yourself? \"Make it fairer!\" It's not enough that you're the 'all-powerful Archivist', you also have to appoint yourself the literal judge of everyone as well?",
  "I know what it's like to be powerless. A-And I know you do too. And I also know what it's like when you get a taste of-- wh-when you're finally able to--",
  "I've been out there with you. I saw the kick you got out of making them scream for once.",
  "You weren't meant to enjoy it this much!",
  "Because I saw your face when we walked into that room!",
  "[Despondent] That wasn't fear, it, it wasn't even anger. It was envy.",
  "And it scared me more than anything else I've seen.",
  "We're here to stop this. Not, not take it over.",
  "I-I don't know, alright! I do-- But there is one.",
  "Because there has to be.",
  "You were the one that wanted to take some time to think things over.",
  "No. I forbid it.",
  "Don't laugh at me.",
  "I refuse to accept that this --",
  "Stupid... Stupid, arrogant..."
 ],
 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "I just -- I need some air.",
  "Yes! N-no! I don't know, just somewhere! Anywhere, without that... thing droning horrors, and Rosie staring at us like we're going to bite her. I just -- I need to think.",
  "I just need a moment. To... to properly consider things.",
  "[Quietly] It might be our only option.",
  "It's not like that.",
  "Right. When I said that I would 'replace' Jonah in there, that's not --",
  "That place, the centre of The Eye, i-it's... It wasn't made for him. That's why he's like that, it's too much, it's overwhelmed him, his whole being, just destroyed.",
  "That's not fair!",
  "Would you just listen? Please?",
  "I think... I think that I-I could control it, to, to a certain degree. I could... channel the energies, remake things. Like I've been doing on our journey, but, but on a grand scale.",
  "But that might still help. I-I could... rebalance things. Destroy the avatars, make it so that the people suffering most were the ones who, who deserved it.",
  "I mean, that has to be better than those that chose it right? Sure I can't make it \"go away\", but I could at least make it fairer. The Eye doesn't care, as long as it gets its fear, it's happy either way.",
  "That's not what this is!",
  "What happened to \"Kill Bill\"?",
  "Why won't you believe me when I say that this isn't something I want to do?",
  "What other choice do we have?",
  "But what if there isn't? How long are we going to wander around hopelessly searching before we end up back here anyway?",
  "We can't just dismiss this. It might be our only option.",
  "[Incredulous] You forbid it?",
  "Why not? You're being ridiculous.",
  "Tough! The world doesn't care what you accept. It just... is!",
  "It just is.",
  "I'm going out. Ou-outside. I-I'll... I'll see you back at the tunnels.",
  "Get out of here. All of you.",
  "[Attempted compulsion] I said leave me alone!",
  "What do you want? No, I, I know what you want.",
  "But maybe you're right.",
  "No, that's -- Martin's right. It's not worth it.",
  "Why am I even talking to you? You don't even have a mind, not really. That's what you want, isn't it? Something to be your focus, your will. Keeping you fed and placated and content!",
  "You got something to say?",
  "Then say it.",
  "The old man was dead. The old man was dead, and Malcolm could feel nothing but ice-cold relief washing over him. Every step he took seemed lighter.",
  "The iris was dull grey, surrounded by yellowed, bloodshot tissue, and the pupil was dull, almost cloudy, but the eye staring out from his shoulder seemed to focus well enough.",
  "\"They're to laugh at you,\" it hissed.",
  "\"No, they won't.\"",
  "\"They're going to tell you that you're a freak, a deviant. They're going to put you away.\"",
  "\"They're going to cut you out of me.\"",
  "\"So you can kill me again?\"",
  "\"I didn't kill you.\"",
  "\"You might as well have. With your insolence. With your disrespect.\"",
  "\"I'll tell them. I'll tell all about the horrible thoughts you keep deep inside.\"",
  "He was going to have to do it himself. That's all there was to it. If a professional, medical option wasn't on the cards then what other choice did he have?",
  "\"Let me see, Malcolm. Let me see!\"\"",
  "Malcolm ran out of the store, dropping his items as he went. All except the kitchen knife.",
  "\"Do it, you coward!\"",
  "From the wound came first a hand, then slowly, inch by inch, the arm followed, wrapping itself around his neck for purchase, and pulling out a shoulder, a neck, a face. A sneering, familiar face.",
  "It took ten minutes for the bloody form to emerge in its entirety, and another twenty for it to writhe and crawl its way over and up onto the old armchair.",
  "Not exactly subtle. But then you never were, were you? Not really.",
  "If that's the most compelling argument you have...",
  "[Smiles] I'm going to go apologise to my boyfriend.",
  "Martin I'm, I'm sorry. You're right, I --",
  "Sorry. Thought you were someone else.",
  "Why? What's -- Sorry, um, do you know where Martin -- the, the man I-I was with, do you know where he is?",
  "[Suspicious] What, what woman?",
  "What did she look like?",
  "A-Annabelle, oh --",
  "Shh-shh! I --",
  "Please, I need to concentrate.",
  "[Very quietly] Right, Martin... Don't try and do this to me. Not now.",
  "Argh! Oh god. Okay, um...",
  "We, uh -- I need to talk to the, the, the prophets.",
  "[Frustrated] Nothing. Is, is Georgie back yet?",
  "Melanie, please, not now.",
  "Nothing. They're hidden. Annabelle must have taken the camera.",
  "Yes. I checked. I guess she liked him enough to do that for him before she stole it.",
  "No, i-it's what he wanted. What he said he wanted. But... it-it-it means there's no way I can find them!",
  "And I --",
  "Yeah. No. I, I mean, that could work.",
  "But... But if she finds them alone! I mean, if anything were to happen!",
  "You're right. You're right.",
  "This is my fault.",
  "We... We had an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. If, if I hadn't we would have come back here together, and I-I'd have been there to stop her taking him.",
  "I mean, he wouldn't have gone willingly!",
  "But if it happened in the tunnel, I can't 'know' that!",
  "What? So you think he chose to leave with her?",
  "I mean, if they left together willingly, they could already be miles away.",
  "Not unless I'm right next to it.",
  "To get to me? To turn him against us, or,or make him an offer or... I don't know, she serves The Web, so it's probably some bullshit domino cause-and-effect thing we can't even begin to guess.",
  "Then why would she hide?",
  "[Exasperated] How am I supposed to know? I-I can't see anything down here!",
  "Just listen, Melanie. I -- argh!",
  "Ow... I don't know! Somewhere she'd be strong! A, a place of power, a, a Web domain...",
  "No, i-it's all Eye, one way or another.",
  "[Realising] Oh god...",
  "They're going to Hill Top Road."

 "CELIA": [
  "It's okay. I-I was actually looking for you.",
  "That's what I wanted to check! I saw him a while ago, up near one of the trapdoors. I... I didn't recognise the woman with him, so I wanted to check if you were expecting anyone else before I woke the prophets.",
  "I don't know.",
  "Uh... Youngish, Black, dressed... normal, I suppose. She had a thing on her head, like a... I don't know. Like a, a woolly hat? But... I-I don't know, it looked a bit weird.",
  "I didn't catch her name --",
  "Are you alright?",
  "What's going on?"
 ],
 "MELANIE": [
  "Not yet. But then she needs to actually go places to look at them. She can't just pop up top and check 'the big picture'.",
  "So, you, you didn't see them at all with your, y'know...?",
  "O-oh. So does that mean he's...?",
  "Remind me not to get on her good side.",
  "Hey, hey, hey!",
  "Keep it together. Okay. Georgie might have better luck. She's actually looking in person, and from what you said...",
  "They can handle themselves. Right?",
  "It's, it's fine. I'm worried too.",
  "You don't know that's what happened.",
  "You tell me. You said there was no sign of a struggle.",
  "But we'd have heard. Stuff echoes down here.",
  "Does it matter right now?",
  "[Heavy sigh] Yeah. And you can't -- I, I don't know, see where your blind spot is? I-If you know what I mean.",
  "Right. Fine. So... we do this the old fashioned way.",
  "Why would she take him? Uh, do they have any history?",
  "So what other reason might she want him?",
  "Okay. Probably, okay, but it doesn't do us much good to worry about that now.",
  "Uh, okay. Let's say, she wanted to use him as bait, to lure you somewhere.",
  "To get a headstart, maybe? So she can set up a trap. Either way, where would she go?",
  "For god's sake! Pull your head out of your arse, stop trying to use it as a bloody antenna, and actually try thinking!",
  "Yeah... I, I don't think there's anywhere like that in London",
  "So, what about nearby?"
