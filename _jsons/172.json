  "They turn back towards the wings, keen to make their exit, but where they stood a moment before, there is now a dangling hook.",

  "There is a thin trickle of blood.",
  "> There is a thick shot of pain.",
  "> FRANCIS'S FATHER, offstage: \"Useless piece of shit.",
  "You need to grow up\"!",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> The hook lifts FRANCIS's leg off the ground.",
  "They hop painfully, trying to escape, but the thread pulls tight, dragging them towards the table.",
  "> THE SPIDER, offstage: \"What a funny little dance, Francis.",
  "Such a funny dance\".",
  "> FRANCIS simply screams in response.",
  "It is a scream of anger as much as it is of pain, and it cannot hide the dreadful inevitability they feel.",
  "The dull terror that this act will end like all the others.",
  "> In their thrashing jig they stumble into another hanging hook.",

  "> THE SPIDER's giggle echoes around the stage.",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> THE SPIDER twists the string, alternating which of the two lines is taut, causing FRANCIS to whirl and pivot towards the table.",
  "> Its bulbous, distended abdomen can now begin to be seen protruding from above the curtains that fringe the stage.",
  "> FRANCIS goes limp, briefly allowing THE SPIDER to guide their movements smoothly.",
  "> THE SPIDER: \"Good, Francis.",
  "> Without warning, FRANCIS kicks their free leg against the table.",
  "It does not move.",
  "It is part of the tableau.",
  "> The force of the motion sends them staggering backwards; another hook brushes their cheek and takes its chance, ripping through the corner of their mouth and pulling it up into a grimace.",
  "> RYAN, a friend, offstage: \"You never smile when you're clean, did you know that?",
  "I mean, what have you got to be so sad about?",
  "You do make it hard sometimes.",
  "I don't know\".",
  "> FRANCIS tries to respond, but the hook in their mouth pulls tight, and their lips curve upwards, distorting the words.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"Shut *up!",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> FRANCIS tries to use their free hand to pull the razored metal barb from their mouth, but THE SPIDER reaches down a leg and pulls, hoisting its victim up by their face.",
  "> The agonizing motion is too sudden to even give them time to scream, and their free leg kicks out, impotently into the air.",
  "It hits against another hook, which penetrates their worn and weary boots with ease, digging up through the sole and out through the back of the ankle.",
  "> CHRISTIE, a lover, offstage: \"Come on.",
  "Helps me get in the mood, you know?",
  "Just a nice thing to do together.",
  "Makes me feel close to you\".",
  "> As it lowers them back to the ground, FRANCIS tries again to curse at THE SPIDER.",
  "To tell it it has no right to these voices, to leave all of them out of this.",
  "> But the pain of the hooks travels up and down their veins in thin lines of needling torment and robs them of their voice.",
  "> THE SPIDER leans closer.",
  "Its grinning face and quivering mandibles can now be seen; its abdomen throbs with anticipation.",
  "> THE SPIDER: \"Oh, but I did not bring them.",
  "I did not write their lines in your little farce.",
  "*You* are the one that brought them.",
  "*You* devised the steps of this dance; I am simply here to.",
  "help you through them, when you forget\".",
  "\"Oh, watch out\"!",
  "> THE SPIDER pulls abruptly on the threads hooked into FRANCIS's legs, and they tumble forward, faceplanting in a nasty-looking pratfall.",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> FRANCIS's free hand hits at the wooden floor of the stage weakly.",
  "It is unclear whether they hope to achieve something or if it is just an expression of despair.",
  "> The hook in their cheek pulls tight enough to form a grim smile of sorts.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"What do you want\"?",
  "> THE SPIDER: \"The same thing I always want, Francis, every time we do this dance, every single act of our -- hilarious production.",
  "I want what you want, deep, deep down in the hidden bit of you you've tried so hard to kill.",
  "*You can't wait for the dance to conclude.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"I don't want that anymore.",
  "It's different now; *I'm* different now.",
  "I've worked *so hard*\".",
  "> THE SPIDER: \"I don't *care.",
  "> The strings all go taut at once, yanking the weakly protesting Francis to their feet.",
  "> They are dragged, back and forth and around in a series of clumsy motions that, in another time, in another place, might have been a waltz.",
  "> But a waltz has a partner.",
  "FRANCIS only has a desire, an itch in their bones that flows into them, drip by oily drip, down the glistening strands that suspend them, guide them, hold them.",
  "A desire which injects itself through razor-sharp hooks and pools inside their stomach.",
  "> They don't *want* to want it, but.",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> THE SPIDER: \"A *fine* dance, Francis; that last measure I barely plucked the strings.",
  "It's time for a break.",
  "I know how much you've been looking forward to it\".",
  "> THE SPIDER is almost fully descended now; its bulk eclipses everything above FRANCIS's head and it swells with joy and amusement.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"Please.",
  "Let me go.",
  "Just let me go\".",
  "> THE SPIDER: \"Oh, Francis.",
  "It's such a shame that I couldn't do such a thing even if I wanted to.",
  "The man in the audience saw to *that.",
  "*  I am no more free than you are, little puppet.",
  "If only you could see the strings that bind *me*, that wind together as they pull me along my own path.",
  "Perhaps then you would not blame me so.",
  "But *they* are not the tripping threads we are here to watch, no.",
  "So sit, Francis.",
  "> Another tug of the hooks stretches the skin as FRANCIS staggers towards the table.",
  "> The blood flows faster, so dark it is almost black.",
  "Their chest rises and falls rapidly as they are lowered into the only seat, the dusty air of the theater scratching their throat and drying their mouth.",
  "There is the taste of tin, growing stronger.",
  "> The hits are all arranged before them, spread across the table in a cornucopia of promised oblivions, releases, and delights.",
  "FRANCIS feels the hooks tighten as they look upon the offering.",
  "> That deepest want bubbles up to the surface, but at its core there is still that mute fear, that anticipation of what surrender will bring.",
  "> There is no escape to be found here, no respite from the charade that is now found to be the sum of FRANCIS's existence.",
  "By now, FRANCIS knows with utter clarity what falling to the call will bring, the awful crawling fate that they *will* endure before the next act eventually begins.",
  "> The syringe vibrates, almost imperceptibly, as the dark mass of legs and tiny, glittering eyes that sit within it shifts in anticipation.",
  "The cork of the bottle moves ever so slightly proud of the top, pushed by the unfurling thing inside.",
  "The cigarette scuttles closer, inch by impatient inch.",
  "Their longing is awful.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"I don't want it.",
  "Any of it\".",
  "> THE SPIDER does not reply.",
  "> Staring over the table, a memory now tugs at FRANCIS, the faintest residue of an earlier time, when the things before them would have brought a genuine joy to their heart and even a temporary peace.",
  "> For all their keen awareness of what it might mean to do so, FRANCIS cannot deny the want THE SPIDER has gifted them.",
  "> They resist.",
  "They sit oh-so-very still and keep their hands held tight to their chest.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"No.",
  "Not this time.",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> FRANCIS looks up at THE SPIDER, so close now the thick drippings of its jaws fall onto their shoulders in a sticky stream.",
  "It says nothing, but a hook leaps from the darkness backstage, fastening itself into the soft skin at the back of FRANCIS's free hand.",
  "> FRANCIS, offstage: \"You don't get it, like -- it's my decision.",
  "I know what I'm doing; just -- can we stop talking about it, please?",
  "It's fine, i-it just.",
  "> FRANCIS's whole body shudders at the sound of their own voice, as the hook pulls their arm forward, across the table.",
  "> FRANCIS: \"No.",
  "> Their hand closes on the bottle, which shifts and chitters with delight as  FRANCIS, shaking, brings it close.",
  "> THE SPIDER's legs twitch and jerk as it shifts the doomed marionette's strings.",
  "FRANCIS watches as their hand gently uncorks the bottle, and the first of the tiny crawling spiders begins to emerge -- just as their mouth is yanked open by its hook and their arm upends the bottle.",
  "> As FRANCIS feels the cascade crawl down their tongue and over their throat, they wonder just for a moment, whether this is better or worse than when they scuttle up into their veins, or down into their lungs.",
  "> It is an impossible question, and quite, quite pointless.",
  "> Above them, their tormentor cries out in exaltation as its abdomen ruptures, and the spiders within are joined by a rain of countless, tiny legs from above, covering them, embracing them.",
  "> There is no unconsciousness here, no calm detachment or serene buzz.",
  "There is only -- the arachnids.",
  "> And so it will be until the curtain descends at last and THE SPIDER resets the scene, its belly already beginning to swell once again with replacements for the creatures it so gorily birthed.",
  "> Pause for laughter.",
  "> And so the curtain descends.",
