  "Oh, erm, hello Elias.",
  "Not really, I'm sort of in the middle of something.",
  "A complaint? I could just as easily complain about her wasting my time!",
  "I wouldn't even have had to do the recording if Rosie kept her equipment in better condition.",
  "Fine, fine, I'll be more lovely. Now, can I get back to work?",
  "Oh, he's off sick this week. Stomach problems, I think.",
  "Blessed relief if you ask me."

 "ELIAS": [
  "Do you have a moment?",
  "I understand, it's just that Miss Herne has lodged a complaint.",
  "That's not how it works, Jonathan.",
  "Regardless, I would prefer that you not antagonise anyone connected to the Lukas family. They are patrons of the Institute, after all.",
  "Very well. By the way, have you seen Martin?"
