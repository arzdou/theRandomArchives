 "MARTIN": [
  "Right.  Martin Blackwood, archi--",
  "Assistant to Peter Lukas, Head of the Magnus Institute. Recording statement number 0060122. Statement of Adelard Dekker,",
  "taken from a letter to Gertrude Robinson, dated 22nd January, 2006.",
  "Gertrude. Sorry I can't be there in person to go over all this with you. I -- still have a few things to clear up over here.",
  "But I thought it would be best to let you know as soon as possible. I am now certain my theory is correct. There is something new emerging. A fifteenth Power.",
  "They followed a preacher named William Miller, who believed he had calculated exactly when the end of days was coming, and pinned it down to October 22nd, 1844.",
  "He gave no details on how he believed they might look like, or how they might behave, but his predictions for the final days of humanity were unpleasant and visceral.",
  "Anyway, the point is that sometime after that essay was published, Garland Hillier disappeared. Exactly when this happened, no one is really sure, but the last records of his existence can be found near the end of 1867.",
  "No contemporaries commented on his disappearance, nor was there any search inquiry. But neither is there any record of his death or indication of emigration or travel.",
  "Despite his *dubious* academic credentials, he was apparently a man who consistently attempted to court the public eye, and his disappearance has long been a puzzlement, if not a full-blown mystery, in certain academic circles for a long time.",
  "So it's probably not surprising that when Bernadette got a call from Paris telling her that some workman had discovered Garland Hillier's apartment, it got her on a train almost immediately.",
  "The door is the door.",
  "But that couldn't be the case, she knew, as there had been no sign of a body.",
  "She turned to leave, and that, she says, is when she started to get the sense that something was wrong.",
  "The door had been damaged by the builders who uncovered the place, and there were several distinct gaps in the wood, but as she walked back out, the door appeared to be whole.",
  "She ignored it, and left anyways, trying to reason it all as a strange quirk of memory. Just \"one of those things.\"",
  "Unfortunately for her, it was not the only thing that had changed. The walls of the stairwell were discolored, as though covered with a dusting of some faint yellowish dirt, and the stone steps were ever so slightly sticky beneath her shoes.",
  "When she stepped outside into the street of corpses, that was when her mind could no longer deny that she was not in any Paris that she knew, no matter what the architecture might have looked like.",
  "Bernadette says she was sure nothing had moved in that dead city for a hundred years. She was mistaken.",
  "Now, I know what you're going to say, Gertrude. Odd doors are a sign of the Spiral; empty worlds tend towards the Lonely; and eschatology is almost literally the study of the End.",
  "Until then,  I'll keep searching for evidence,  trying to find instances and manifestations of the Extinction.",
  "I'll keep you updated. Stay safe.",
  "So that's it, is it?",
  "A new power.",
  "So --  -- so what, you're afraid of the competition?",
  "So -- So this is, what?",
  "I'm listening.",
  "S-S-so, what, you want to -- stop it being -- *born?*",
  "Okay, m, okay, so -- so let's say -- for now -- that I believe you. *Hypothetically.* Wh-what does this have to do with me?",
  "And you thought that since I'm *so* lonely already, I'd be ideal.",
  "You see -- The thing is, Peter, I'm still *not all that keen* on being a part of any ritual you set up. You know -- In *fact,* if I were to be blunt, I'd say that it would be *suicidally stupid.*",
  "Peter, Peter!",
  "What about the delivery guy? Breekon. *And* the coffin!",
  "You *thought* wrong.",
  "Are we going to talk about John?",
  "I -- wh--",
  "Oh, oh, yeah,  sure.",
  "What, turning invisible and *eavesdropping?*",
  "Or -- *anything,* apparently.",
  "No, she's not a de--",
  "He's not a *moron.*",
  "I don't know. And I just -- felt like it might help. He's always recording, and I thought it -- it might help him... find his way out.",
  "I don't know. Maybe? I-I, I definitely wanted to do it.",
  "I'm -- I'm not sure where the idea came from.",
  "It -- was a *statement,* alright; that's what we *do.*"

 "PETER": [
  "The Extinction, yes.",
  "Not at all. Honestly, that's the sort of thing I normally relish; I've always been a little bit of a gambler, and the higher the stakes the better.",
  "This is different.",
  "Good. It's about time.",
  "There are two powers that, to my knowledge, have never attempted to fully manifest. Never had followers set them up for a ritual. Mother of Puppets, and Terminus. The Web and the End.",
  "The Web, I've never really been sure about. If I were to guess, I would say it actually prefers the world as is: playing everyone against each other. And so on.",
  "The End, on the other hand... The End doesn't really need one. It knows that it gets everything eventually, so why bother? The End manifesting would not be a new world of terror; it would be a lifeless world. Devoid of everything.",
  "But I, and those like me, would rather that did not happen.",
  "I don't know if such a thing is even possible, but if it is, then yes. Or at the very least weaken it.",
  "I'm still working out some of the kinks, but I believe I have a plan. However, it requires this place, and it requires someone touched by the Beholding. Elias was, perhaps unsurprisingly, unwilling to help.",
  "*Anyway.*  The point is that yes, obviously, if I last that long, I'm going to try again. But I'm rather keen for the world not to end in the meantime?",
  "Martin, this is what we agreed. After the Flesh attacked, you -- came to me.",
  "And I've held up my end of the bargain, despite your continued hesitation. Your friends have been largely untroubled by the many, *many* enemies that they have made.",
  "Was that its name? To be honest with you, I thought it was dead.",
  "True enough. And as soon as I learned it was here, I moved to intervene. But, well, it turns out I wasn't really needed. And as far as the coffin goes, there's not much I can do about a *bull-headed* Archivist --",
  "-- who seems hell bent on self-destruction. My powers only extend so far.",
  "*Look.* I'm not going to pressure you into doing anything you don't want to. It won't even *work* unless you're willing to commit.",
  "In any case, I have plenty of preparations to work on myself before it's ready. I'll see what else I can find to help with your reservations in the meantime, okay?",
  "Just -- don't hesitate too long? We are on a deadline after all.",
  "Right. Then if you'll excuse me, I have a family thing to get to.",
  "Do we need to?",
  "Because to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what's been going on with him these past couple of weeks.",
  "*Martin.* My patron -- hopefully *our* patron, someday -- doesn't give me any sort of special insights. I'm not quite the accomplished voyeur that Elias was; I have to keep tabs on things the old-fashioned way.",
  "If you like. But -- I'm only one person, and I can't keep an eye on everything.",
  "As I said, one of the last shreds of the Circus delivered a gateway into Too-Close-I-Cannot-Breathe. I went to help, but was too late. Then, your detective friend --",
  "-- left on one of Elias's wild goose chases. Then John willfully hurled himself into the coffin. I did not intervene because thankfully, I did *not* agree to protect *your* friends from their own idiocy.",
  "Though actually, he gave it more consideration than I thought he would.",
  "Now, from my point of view, so far, none of this has been any of my business. We have bigger concerns than this little soap opera you call an Archive.",
  "What does -- puzzle me though, and I mean that genuinely, is -- why you were piling tape recorders onto the coffin while John was in there.  It's a question, Martin, it's -- it's not an accusation.",
  "Interesting. Were you compelled?",
  "You should watch out for that. Could be something dangerous.",
  "I can't help but notice you're recording right now?",
  "Anyway. Point is, I'm not your captor or your torturer. I'm not going to tell you to stop talking to him, or even saving him if it comes to it. If that's not a decision you're willing to make yourself, me scolding you isn't going to help.",
  "You know what the stakes are now, and I just have to hope that you're with me on this. Focusing on the big picture.",
  "Okay! Now, I really am running late, so if you don't mind?"
