 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "There is a sickness in this village.",
  "Perhaps you would not see it from a distance, and the faint sting of rot on the breeze is easy enough to dismiss.",
  "But as you get closer, that infectious feeling of wrongness is harder and harder to shake.",
  "The grass is not the green of nature, the buildings are warped by more than age, and the voices that come from behind the inhabitants' masks are hoarse and wet.",
  "They move with exaggerated casualness, a parody of idyllic village life.",
  "And when they have a break from weeping, they reassure each other how wonderful it is in their village, or at least how wonderful it used to be.",
  "Each is covered from head to toe in thick black fabric, and they never, ever touch.",
  "Take a deep breath.",
  "*It's so quiet there, and everyone cares for each other, far from the din and compacted flesh of the city.",
  "In the center, a maypole stands, mildewed strips of colored cloth hanging limply from it like shreds of ragged skin.",
  "The base of the pole is ashen and charred.",
  "The disease itself is nothing special.",
  "It begins as a small patch of discolored skin, the tiniest blemish.",
  "Scrub it off, and it is gone!",
  "For a few hours, at least.",
  "But it returns again and again, and begins to spread, a mold with tendrils that burrow deep.",
  "It ranges in color from rancid yellow and corpse-fat white to the dull, angry purple of a fresh bruise.",
  "It itches, and burns, and you can feel it growing and spreading inside you, looking for the core of you.",
  "At least until it worms its way into your bones.",
  "Beneath the coat of each terrified citizen of this sick village lies a lurking possibility, a nightmarish suspicion of infectious constellations of hungry mildew, a mutating technical atlas of rotten and pockmarked flesh.",
  "But who can know for sure?",
  "Their coats are oh, so thick.",
  "There was never a time before the disease, no matter what the old bastards tell you.",
  "It has always been in the village, always festered in the dark corners where no one could stomach to check.",
  "Where good neighbors wouldn't dream to speculate.",
  "But those who live here will tell you different.",
  "From behind their masks those friendly voices will tell you how it used to be: clean, and hygenic, and *always* bathed in sepia sunshine.",
  "They *know* in the guts of them this sickness has come from outside, that it is those from beyond the village that have done this to them.",
  "*They brought it here,* they whisper to each other in the unnamed pub, hunched and bloated over their pale and stinking beers, lifting their masks to take a mouthful, puce faces and frightened sneers exposed for just a moment.",
  "*They couldn't leave us well enough alone.",
  "They wanted what we have, our perfect peaceful life, and so they dragged their sickness here and damned us all.",
  "The patrons speak quietly, 'cause who can say for sure if the face behind a mask is a good, honest village face -- or a sickness-bearing harbinger from beyond?",
  "And people do still come to the village, for however thick the paranoia, however terrible the disease, there are worse things beyond.",
  "They are stopped, of course.",
  "Beaten and stripped and checked head to toe for any sign of infection.",
  "The village council sees to that.",
  "Most are uncontaminated, though that does little to save them, while others are already laced right through with fungus of their own.",
  "A few are spared brutality, and treated with such cordial politeness you must have thought their inquisitors old friends.",
  "Though there seems on the surface no rhyme to such decisions, were you to look below their coats, you might see the patterns of their mold were matched.",
  "It is, alas, those who are unblemished who suffer worst.",
  "So incomprehensible is it that any from outside could be clean, that there might be another source or vector, the inspectors devise another theory: An invisible infection.",
  "A hundred Typhoid Marys spreading mildew and decay.",
  "They keep them in the post office, wrapped in chicken wire, prodded and jeered and watched.",
  "Should they begin to show signs of the rot, then maybe, just maybe, they can stay for now, though nobody will doubt that it was *they* brought the illness.",
  "But if they stay clean, if they continue to act like they are better, like they are above the sickness that it is certain that they must have brought to the village, then that cannot be endured.",
  "So they are taken to the village green, and the scorch marks at the base of the maypole get darker.",
  "The villagers stand on the green to watch, ignoring the bending of the grass as it tries to worm its way through their boots.",
  "They watch the screaming outsider as the fire purifies them, and inside feel the gnawing panic of their own secrets.",
  "For how long ago did they really come to the village?",
  "How deep did their roots go?",
  "Do any of them truly remember?",
  "What if *they* are an outsider?",
  "What if they're found out?",
  "Such fears are to be quashed and swallowed; they must stand strong; they must stand together as one body against the mass of those beyond the village who would see them degraded and destroyed.",
  "They cannot allow such secret terrors to break their unity.",
  "And the maypole watches over all.",
  "There is no house in town that has not found itself marked with the red cross of plague, but paint is fleeting and the villagers are *so* desperate to hide their state.",
  "Night still falls here, if only to give those that wish it a chance to try and hide their frantic denials.",
  "As the weak dawn breaks, you may count the doors now painted white, and see who is more conscientious in covering their spongy skin.",
  "The deception is pitiable, and yet deep down every villager knows the mold has marked them *deeper* than any of the others, and carries it as their most secret shame.",
  "Their masks are blue and red and white, and their coats are the color of fresh ivory, stained sometimes with streaks of crimson from their dutiful ministrations.",
  "None would dare accuse them of infection, and to cross them or draw their eye is to invite the strongest diagnosis.",
  "Head of the council is Jillian Smith.",
  "Her father's father's father's father's father built the maypole, carved from a jackalberry tree and painted in the colors of the village.",
  "This place is her home and her right and her duty, and woe to any fungus-riddled outsider who might believe it otherwise.",
  "For no one would speak up if Jillian Smith were to mark you infected or declare you foreign.",
  "No one would lift a finger as they dragged you to the green.",
  "Her gloves are purest white and never sullied, and they hide a cerulean mold that covers every inch of her, through skin, muscle, and organ, though she has no idea it runs so deep.",
  "By night, she sits in the quiet darkness of her perfect cottage, peeling herself with a straight razor, layer by layer, desperate to reach the pure flesh she is so sure must still be in there, somewhere.",
  "Her living room is the same suffocation blue as the rest of her, every surface piled high with her own discarded bloody skin, and she has no terror deeper than the thought she might be discovered.",
  "As she pulls spongy strips free one agonizing fiber at a time, she stares from the window at the house of her neighbor, Mrs Kim.",
  "Mrs Kim is not on the village council.",
  "Mrs Kim keeps to herself.",
  "And Jillian Smith is certain Mrs Kim is not infected, and *hates* her for it.",
  "What Mrs Kim is, is scared.",
  "Should she accuse someone else?",
  "Send them to the village green?",
  "Perhaps she might petition to join the village council, though that would invite their attention as much as anything might.",
  "Even through the masks, Mrs Kim knows the looks she gets in the pub.",
  "But what can she do?",
  "When she hears the shouts outside and sees the smoke pouring from the thatch roof, she knows it is too late.",
  "They drag her to the maypole, their masks hiding the tears of terror and angry shame, and lash her there with those strips of cloth that never seem to burn.",
  "Mrs Kim does not fight, though she screams and screams and screams as all her fears are realized.",
  "Jillian Smith tries to smile as she watches her neighbor burn, but the fungus is too thick around her lips, and her face no longer moves.",
  "As the flames consume the last of Mrs Kim in thick and acrid smoke, the mold reaches the bones of Jillian Smith, and she *blooms*.",
  "In a moment she is swollen, bloated, bursting into a cloud of violet spores that envelop the green and those who dwell there, embracing them in a rot that long since seeped into the soil of this blighted land.",
  "We're *not* infected, Martin; that place --  It isn't *for* us.",
  "I just -- *Do.",
  "* I just know it.",
  "And it, and it feels more -- deliberate.",
  "Like I have more control now.",
  "I don't -- Ask me a question!",
  "One I can't possibly know already.",
  "Y-- You don't have one!",
  "You -- I actually *believed* you!",
  "\"That's ridiculous,\" I thought, \"That's not a real name, but he wouldn't *lie* to me\".",
  "Out there, not trapped in a, in a, a hellscape, but -- moving.",
  "She's -- She's looking for Daisy.",
  "She's a few steps behind.",
  "Oh, Daisy, I'm sorry.",
  "She --  -- *thinks* she's going to kill Daisy.",
  "Like she promised.",
  "But she's conflicted.",
  "I don't know; th-the future, th, th,that's.",
  "not something I can see.",
  "A long way.",
  "Through many dark and awful places.",
  "I -- Um, I, I'm okay.",
  "It's a little -- strange?",
  "But it doesn't hurt.",
  "Keep going; you have -- questions, let's hear them.",
  "* I'm -- I'm not -- sure.",
  "I can't really see Melanie, or, or Georgie.",
  "No, no -- I, I don't think so; if they were dead, I -- I think I *would* know that, I just --  I don't know -- where they are, w,what they're doing.",
  "He's inside the Panopticon.",
  "The tower, far above the world.",
  "Hard to say.",
  "The, The way this works, this -- new sight, the knowledge is, is.",
  "somehow wrapped up in the Panopticon?",
  "An eye can't -- see inside itself.",
  "But I can feel him in there.",
  "Yes, sort of, we're --  I don't know how to phrase it, we're -- something between a pilgrim and a moth.",
  "We can walk through these little worlds of terror, watching them.",
  "Separate, and untouched.",
  "I like it better than the alternative.",
  "I *think* it was Annabelle Cane.",
  "That's -- weird; I -- I know the Web was wrapped around that phone, but, but I can't -- see her.",
  "A, At all.",
  "At least with Georgie and Melanie I have a vague sense they're still alive, i-in London, and o-- well, what *was* London.",
  "Well, I *know* that's a bad idea.",
  "Okay, no; that one was a -- very *reasonable* guess.",
  "I'll, I'll be honest, I'm starting to feel a bit -- self-conscious being a post-apocalyptic Google?",
  "Uh, i-it's, uh -- I'm sorry -- trying to know things about them directly, i,i,it's like --  God, it's like looking into the Sun.",
  "Martin, turn around.",
  "Wish I was!",
  "Do you want to do the honors?",
  "How did you find us?",
  "Yes, I suppose I do.",
  "Oh -- yes, sorry, uh -- The Distortion can always find anyone who has -- crossed its threshold.",
  "Like you said, I can know everything now, including how much of a lie that really is.",
  "What do you want.",
  "*  Look, I've no interest in your -- gloating.",
  "You could have --  You knew what was happening.",
  "Leave them out of this, they didn't know!",
  "No, I don't think that's a good idea.",
  "*Martin*, it's not that si-simple.",
  "But mainly for you.",
  "I don't doubt it.",
  "I am *not*, nor have I ever *been,* \"adorable\".",
  "Martin, she's -- a cruel, vicious monster!"
