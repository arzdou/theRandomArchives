 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "Statement of Carter Chilcott, regarding his time spent in isolation aboard the space station Daedalus in September 2007.",
  "Original statement given April 4, 2009. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "We're all alone out there.",
  "And nothing shall mark our passing because there is nothing to do so.",
  "I should have realized that what they meant by \"crew member\" was \"lab monkey\". But to be honest, even after I found this out it didn't do a lot to dampen my enthusiasm for the project. I was going to space.",
  "I also had one large domed window. It allowed me a decent view of the Earth below, as well as plenty of chance to stare off into space, which I did quite a lot in those early days.",
  "Both of these comforts lasted me almost six weeks. That was when I was aware I should start to experience some of the more distressing side effects.",
  "I'd already passed through listlessness and a bout of insomnia. And I hadn't been using my exercise machine properly for almost a fortnight, but I still didn't expect the severity of the hallucinations when they began.",
  "So this was all reasonably distressing, but at least it had the advantage of not being unexpected. No, the first warning I got about how bad things were going to get was the spacesuit.",
  "It was a hand. The white bulky gloved hand of someone wearing an EVA suit. It started to float slowly across the window, followed by the rest of the arm, then the torso, 'till almost the whole suit slowly floating across.",
  "There was nobody inside. The floating suit was completely empty.",
  "And I started to suddenly get very scared.",
  "At last it had passed right across and off into the night, the other side, and I stopped to try and calm myself in the face of what had been a deeply strange thing to watch. I managed to do so, but only until I looked again out of that window.",
  "The Earth was gone.",
  "At first I assumed it must have been an orientation change, but that didn't make any sense. The planet below had never been hidden from my position before and if we shifted that radically I would have felt it, I was sure.",
  "After two days of waiting, I finally accepted the sun and the moon had gone as well.",
  "It wasn't completely empty out there. Far off in the distance I could still see stars twinkling. Probably long dead, but I knew that there was nothing they could do to save me.",
  "Transmitting nothing. Powering nothing. Connected to nothing.",
  "The camera had never even been turned on, and had certainly not been transmitting anything to Earth. So what data had they been collecting?",
  "I still have no idea the answer to that question, but I did feel like I gained some small sliver of control back after spending an all-too-brief hour smashing up the camera.",
  "I opened the small safe that contained the passcode document and easily broke the seal on its container. I was desperate to get out of that door as soon as possible and took a few moments to memorize it.",
  "\"No one is coming\"",
  "and the door remained closed.",
  "And that was it. I was trapped alone in a tiny room floating in space deserted empty space. I had plenty of food and water so starvation wasn't a danger, but sometime in the first week the clock stopped working.",
  "I don't know exactly when I realized I wasn't dead. There were various moments I faded back into consciousness and I know that I felt the re-entry very hard. But it is difficult to pin down clear thoughts before the hospital.",
  "I'm not pushing to know more, not really. I know what happened. And no rational cover story that they could feed me is going to change it.",
  "I haven't followed up with Conrad and as far as I'm aware he hasn't made any attempt to contact me. I was paid in full though, which was a surprise.",
  "I wanted to tell someone what really happened for almost a year before I found your Institute. There's nothing really to be done about it, I wanted to get it off my chest.",
  "So thank you for letting me get it down on paper.",
  "Martin was able to confirm that during its two years of operation it did have a total of three staff on board: Yan Kilbride, Manuela Dominguez, and Mr. Chilcott.",
  "Beyond that, however, there's little that can be retrieved from beyond the wall of corporate bureaucracy. Tim was, however, able to get a list of the businesses involved in the venture.",
  "I fear, however, that's as much digging as I can do at the moment without drawing attention, so it may be wise to let the matter drop.",
  "Sash -- um, I can't seem to find a new file for the Hill Top Road case. I thought I gave it to you to follow up on the children?",
  "Oh, of course, sorry. I didn't realize you were still here or I would have asked.",
  "I'll see if it's with Tim then.",
  "I'm at a loss. Why she would want to destroy files, though? Still I think I probably need to back off from Sasha for a while after this. I'll just keep an eye from a distance for now.",
  "I did find several pictures of her and her new boyfriend, though, which puts my mind somewhat at ease.",
  "Well, mostly. There's something about him that doesn't seem quite right. Something about the smile, maybe.",
  "I, I mean they're all pictures of Sasha and Tom, as I'm told his name is, having fun together, but -- it's hard to put into words, exactly, but every one of them looks somehow like a stock photo."

  "You did and I gave it back.",
