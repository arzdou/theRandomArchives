  "-- Gertrude Robinson.",
  "Don't -- Don't make me, please!",
  "And what do you wish to hear?",
  "Shall I tell you of the decades of preparation?",
  "Of the long wait for the eclipse?",
  "Three hundred years from the failure that birthed the thing that preached from the depths of Maxwell Rayner.",
  "The sacrifices made to birth the Dark Star that would make it all possible?",
  "It was to be a week of night and horror, culminating in the eclipse that passed over Ny-\u00c5lesund on the 20th of March, 2015, almost three hundred years after Halley's eclipse passed over London.",
  "We had hundreds of sacrifices prepared and ready, plunged into darkness and terror for days on end.",
  "All prepared to culminate in the unveiling of that point of purest night at the moment of the eclipse's height.",
  "It would open the door to a world of true and holy darkness, extinguish the sun, and take us to a place where we would be redeemed of our base and corrupt need for light and warmth.",
  "Maxwell was here, with me, prepared for our moment of triumph, and our churches around the world were ready, in those lost and forgotten places of worship, shut up and left in shadow.",
  "Hither Green was, I believe, where *your* Institute was watching, but Natalie's efforts were but a small and meager part of the greater effort.",
  "When they collapsed, it was as nothing to the grand ritual.",
  "perhaps we should have seen it as the first sign of what was happening.",
  "But, we had no idea.",
  "To begin our seven day feast, we slew the still and lightless beast, and drank of its stagnant blood, submerging the first of the sacrifices in the brackish water it had blessed with its stillness.",
  "Maxwell plunged its claws into his chest, freeing the darkness within him, and we waited.",
  "And we sang.",
  "And we exalted in divine stillness.",
  "The darkness was beyond anything that could be imagined, and even in my *wildest* experiments in the void of space, I could not have believed such a peace was possible, as I felt in the quiet whimpering terror of that place.",
  "The sky was light, but we were well-protected, and we knew that when the sun was swallowed in eclipse, the darkness would be complete.",
  "We believed it far too late for anyone to stop us, and the crude methods of your *Archivist* least of all.",
  "The death of a few have never been more than an inconvenience, and that's all she was ever really capable of.",
  "You were not the first to try and stop us, you know.",
  "Not even within living memory.",
  "I was but newly joined when Lynette fled the church, and Maxwell had her silenced.",
  "But I remember her brute of a husband.",
  "He fed the beast for us, you know, when first he believed Lynette might still be saved.",
  "Then, later, we faithful served as his fuel to banish it.",
  "But, not for long.",
  "That's the thing about darkness, isn't it?",
  "You try your hardest to eradicate, flood your surroundings with light, but it's always there at the edges, waiting for the glow to weaken, to return and cover you forever.",
  "Robert Montauk discovered that the hard way.",
  "And someday, so will your Gertrude.",
  "But we got so close.",
  "We touched it.",
  "There is another world, a world of still and quiet darkness, where no heat touches, and death cannot find you.",
  "You might wander beneath that empty sky of void forever, and never see a light to guide your way.",
  "No left, no right.",
  "No up or down.",
  "Only forward, into the crowded, shivering gloom.",
  "For that night is not empty, far from it.",
  "Things move there, the sound of shuffling.",
  "The fall of gentle stagnant raindrops that chills you as you try desperately to know if that is the sound of the storm.",
  "or something out there.",
  "It is a world of the fear of darkness, and as I began to see it, I felt again that celestial terror that had not gripped my heart since first I gazed upon the pitch-black sun that *I* had created.",
  "The scream was mine, and it was joined by uncounted voices in fearful song.",
  "I was complete.",
  "It was so very close.",
  "We were to slice a hole in the world, and this paradise would flow through the wound like ink, smothering the sun, and all its children.",
  "Maxwell had always had the visions, the drive.",
  "Whatever was inside him pulled him to this end, to this great undertaking, like a magnet, and I was so very honored to be his right hand.",
  "*Natalie* and the others followed, but they did not truly understand.",
  "Not *truly*, with their talk of peace and unity and *Mr. Pitch*.",
  "A friendly name, to try and hide from a concept they couldn't grasp.",
  "Vardaan Darvish had an inkling, I thought, but he crossed a Montauk, which has traditionally gone poorly for us.",
  "But as the hours turned into days, and the final dusk drew closer, it seemed as though all the uncertainty was washed away.",
  "I don't know exactly when it all started to come undone.",
  "I think Maxwell first felt the ripples four days before the eclipse was due.",
  "It was strange.",
  "Like a pause in the hysterical whimpering and fruitless prayers of the sacrifices.",
  "And a ripple that was felt through the waters, and the stagnant blood that bound us.",
  "We would later learn that this was the collapse of the ritual at Hither Green.",
  "But it was only the first.",
  "Our congregation in Alaska disappeared the next day, and Russia, as well.",
  "One by one, it seemed our scattered whisperers of night were falling, and holding it together, keeping the lightless world anchored to our star, bringing it closer, was becoming an almost unbearable strain on Maxwell.",
  "I helped as I could, but without knowing what was happening, there was little I could do to stabilize it.",
  "I began to drown the sacrifices.",
  "Too soon, perhaps.",
  "But it worked, to keep it going, and keep it together, until at last, we felt it.",
  "We had been worshipping in the deepest dark, and yet, when it crossed the sun, I felt it rolling over us, like a cooling balm on a summer's day, plunging us into a deep, black void, far more complete than I can ever convey with mere words.",
  "It was divine.",
  "And as we unveiled our new and absent sun, the sacrifices who remained screamed and fell in holy agonies, and the world of endless night we had been promised began to pour in, shining out and all around us.",
  "It touched and caressed our souls with the soothing fears of night, and I heard Maxwell weeping with joy at what we had done.",
  "And then, it stopped.",
  "All at once, that loving embrace was stripped from us, and it began to retreat, to recede back into the place it had come from.",
  "We were *so close!",
  "*  We were so close.",
  "I heard Maxwell cry out, scrambling desperately into the dark sun, stopping *just* short of touching it.",
  "But it was too late.",
  "Whatever it was that you and your *Archivist* did, it clearly worked.",
  "We left, half of us dead, and the other half destroyed by coming so close to the true essence,  and being denied.",
  "In my most wretched hours, I wonder -- perhaps it was us.",
  "Perhaps we simply lacked faith.",
  "We weren't worthy.",
  "The world wasn't worthy.",
  "But -- no.",
  "We were ready.",
  "We had earned our dark rapture.",
  "And we were *robbed*.",
  "I don't know how long we waited after that.",
  "It was weeks before anyone spoke.",
  "when they did.",
  "the arguments began.",
  "The recriminations, the desperate resolutions to try again, to find what went wrong.",
  "But, I could see in his eyes that Maxwell was so very tired.",
  "And all the words fell to nothing.",
  "Instead, we began the search for his successor, a new host for his.",
  "He would regain his strength, and we would plan our next move.",
  "It was difficult, though; the approaching culmination meant Maxwell had not prepared another host, and the search for another vessel was long and involved.",
  "Finally, about eighteen months ago, we found one: a child, whose father had, by coincidence, been directly marked by the Dark.",
  "It was a desperate plan, but we were desperate, a shadow of what we had been.",
  "Maxwell left me here to guard the Black Sun, and everyone else left to help in his rebirth.",
  "But it didn't work, did it?",
  "I can only assume we were too weak to hide from *you*, and you struck when Maxwell was vulnerable.",
  "For the first six months, I let myself hope that my suspicions were unfounded, that the silence I felt was simply.",
  "him lying low, recovering, before returning to his abandoned disciple.",
  "Soon enough, I could no longer fool myself.",
  "He had been slain, and I was alone.",
  "And here I have remained.",
  "Perhaps I have told myself that I am preparing, gathering my own strength, and making plans to continue the church in his name.",
  "But I think in my heart, I have been waiting for this moment.",
  "For the final axe to fall, and finish the last remnant of our holy crusade.",
  "And here, at last, you are.",
  "Now you can kill me like the others.",
  "Well, where is she?",
  "Afraid to face what she's done?",
  "So, how did she do it?",
  "It's been three years waiting, guarding this place without hope.",
  "At least do me the courtesy of telling me *how* she collapsed our moment of triumph.",
  "So, stopping us took everything she had.",
  "That's -- Well -- Then why are you here?",
  "Maxwell is dead.",
  "The ritual failed.",
  "If you're so keen to take everything, undo the work of centuries, it's just through that door.",
  "Only myself, Maxwell, and Natalie could even look upon it.",
  "It will annihilate you both in an instant.",
  "No -- NO!"
