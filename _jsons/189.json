  "This is it, then.",
  "Don't play dumb.",
  "It's the final battle, right? We climb the tower, take out the bad guy, figure out how to change the world back, and back in time for tea.",
  "Yeah. They did roll out the red carpet, didn't they? Must be nice getting the star treatment.",
  "Oh no? What would you call it?",
  "Wow, you're *really* determined not to engage aren't you?",
  "I mean, yeah, okay, but --",
  "[Amused] Seriously? Stage fright? The great Archivist, master of all he surveys can't handle a bit of public attention?",
  "[Sarcastic] Oh, I'm so sorry John, I didn't realise. God forbid you get *uncomfortable*. I guess I'll just tell everyone it's off then, shall I? We'll just go.",
  "You're right, I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, I'm scared too.",
  "I don't follow?",
  "But you're with The Eye too, though, right? So, maybe it's making you stronger as well.",
  "John? Use your words.",
  "Well yeah, obviously.",
  "Hey! Don't talk like that, okay, we can take him!",
  "So what, it's just a, an eldritch popularity contest?",
  "[Searchingly] Maybe it hasn't realised?",
  "[Spluttering a bit] Well, hang on, hang on, okay, let's think about this a moment. You're making a load of assumptions here. You can't see inside, remember? We have no idea what's happening up there.",
  "[Frustrated] Yeah, but that was always going to be the case, wasn't it?",
  "Wait, where are you going?",
  "Oh, yeah, sure! We should just go with one of all those other options that we have hidden up our sleeves, yeah?",
  "[Growing angry] No, d-d-don't \"Martin\" me, okay! We're here because it's this or nothing, right?",
  "And we can't *do* nothing, right?",
  "Great. So, lead on.",
  "Where's the door. John? How do we get inside this monstrosity?",
  "You don't know?",
  "Something's probably blocking you...",
  "[Harshly] For god's sake John!",
  "[Suppressed anger] No it's --",
  "[More calmly] I get it. It's fine. Maybe there's another way in? What's this thing made of anyway, like, like, obsidian or something, right?",
  "Of course it is. Well, if it's just glass, then it won't be hard to break, right? We can just grab something heavy, like one of these cameras, and then all I need...",
  "Oh! Oh! Eurgh...",
  "[Raging] Brilliant! Just brilliant!",
  "[Harshly] Fine... fine.",
  "[More calmly] I'll do a lap of the base. See if I can find any way in through any of the bits that used to be the Institute.",
  "Yeah, alright. Don't worry about me.",
  "Besides if anything happens... at least there's plenty of witnesses.",
  "Be back soon.",
  "[Brightly] All good?",
  "Oh great! Fantastic!",
  "[Blas\u00e9] No! No, nothing's up. Everything is still awful.",
  "I'm... just... really happy to see you.",
  "[Loudly] Ah well! Looks like we aren't getting in here! Never mind! Better... Best head off then, eh?",
  "[Hissed whisper] It's fine, just trust me.",
  "[Whispering] Sorry. Sorry, John. Not sure how much everything up there actually understood what was going on. But, y'know, I didn't want to take any chances so it made sense to... um...",
  "Yeah, basically, more or less.",
  "Yeah, if something messes with his connection, he can get a little... vague.",
  "Wh-- Ooooh... kay...",
  "Friendly faces have been kind of rare. Or weird.",
  "How did you know we were there?",
  "Well, I vote we catch up somewhere that's maybe not quite so close to the sinister mega-tower.",
  "Um. Oh, er...",
  "Oh, uh, er, Melanie, do you need a hand or...",
  "Oh, uh, no, not anymore, we lost it when --"

 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "This is what?",
  "We've certainly got the audience for it.",
  "I'd hardly call flooding Oxford Street with blood, the \"star treatment\".",
  "A very lazy metaphor.",
  "I'm just nervous. Jonah Magnus is waiting at the top of this tower, and he obviously knows we're coming.",
  "And not only that, every eye in an entire city *made of nothing but eyes* is staring at me while I try to prepare.",
  "Well, clearly not.",
  "I'm more comfortable actually *doing* the looking.",
  "You don't need to be sarcastic, okay?",
  "That's what concerns me.",
  "What if *our* fear is feeding him? Making him stronger?",
  "[Softly] No, you're... you're right. Of course you're right. I can't believe I didn't consider it before...",
  "Me vs Elias, Jonah. We... We both draw power from The Eye.",
  "No but -- That -- There's -- I mean, if we face off, try to destroy each other, it's not like it's going to be an actual fight --",
  "No, Martin, listen, what I'm saying is that whichever way you cut it, ultimately it just comes down to who The Eye *chooses*.",
  "Yes. Except one of the contestants is *also* planning to try and murder the judge.",
  "Martin I... I don't see any way I can win this. Not now, not like this.",
  "You're right, meaning we have no idea what he's got planned for us.",
  "We shouldn't have come.",
  "I, uh... Hm.",
  "I'm, I'm not sure.",
  "Maybe. Maybe The Eye doesn't actually want me in there. Or, or it's something Jonah Magnus put in place, or...",
  "Or maybe I can't bring myself to look. Maybe I don't actually want to go inside.",
  "One-way mirrored glass.",
  "Oh, I wouldn't.",
  "[Softly] Warned you.",
  "Look, just... just give me... Let me try to focus, tune out all these watchers. I-I've got a statement to make anyway.",
  "[Tired] Yes. There's a lot here, Martin. A lot.",
  "Just be careful, okay?",
  "That's not funny.",
  "Right, here's your bloody performance...",
  "Across the pit the pallid things gurn at him in indignant curiosity, while on his side he is surrounded by expressions of horrified betrayal.",
  "As he does so the great bell tolls for dinner, and a thousand scuttering servants swarm out and into the chamber, depositing their silver trays before each seat, piled high with succulent, steaming meat.",
  "The minister eats as those outside look on, and all he tastes is salt.",
  "Yes. Just, uh... Left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.",
  "Martin? Wh-- Something's up.",
  "Why are you smiling?",
  "What's going on?",
  "Martin, this is the sort of place where acting strange means I will still ju--",
  "Wha-- Georgie? Melanie? I thought -- This --",
  "Put on a show?",
  "Likewise, I... oh... Ooo...",
  "[Archly] I am not going to collapse. What do you mean again?",
  "[Brokenly] I do not -- I'm just feeling a little bit woozy alright? I ca-can't quite think straight. Like at, um... um, Martin, you remember?",
  "I don't like being discussed like I'm not here.",
  "That's... not what I was expecting.",
  "Okay, this is, uh... this is a-a lot. Why don't we take it from the top?",
  "I'm really glad.",
  "H-How are you here? What, what happened?",
  "I'm sorry to cause a fuss.",
  "So, what's next?",
  "No. No, I don't think it will.",
  "Oh, right you are."

 "MELANIE": [
  "Another reason we should have left them up there. Still. Glad you're alive and that.",
  "Oh, I know that sound. He's going pale, right? Five quid says he's about to collapse again.",
  "Oh come on. You do it all the time.",
  "Then you are going to *love* the others.",
  "It's fine, Georgie. You can use the \"c\" word.",
  "Mmhmm. It's *extremely* weird.",
  "I keep telling her that technically there's no proof of that.",
  "Georgie's got that fearless thing going on, and me and The Eye, well, you remember our messy divorce.",
  "There was nowhere to go back to, so I told her about the tunnels. Turns out, not only were they still here, they actually do a decent job of hiding things. When you aren't painting a huge target on our backs.",
  "[Sharply] What? I'm here, aren't I? I didn't say anything about being nice about it.",
  "So... let me moan.",
  "[Snorts] Bit late for that.",
  "[Sarcastically] Everyone is *so* excited to see the Ceaseless Watcher's special little boy.",
  "[Intensely] I'm going to hold you to that.",
  "No. No, I'm fine. Somehow managed to keep my cane through all of this.",
  "And I know this part of the tunnels pretty well. Besides, do you even have a torch?",
  "[Sharply] Then *I'm* not the one with the problem. I'm told it gets pretty dark."

 "GEORGIE": [
  "It's alright, John. Just keep quiet.",
  "Martin says it's much harder for you to avoid attention up there.",
  "Is this what you were talking about?",
  "There's a small group of... survivors we managed to pull out of some of the nearby hells. They, um... They think we're... 'special'. You know, because The Eye can't see us.",
  "Fine. We've got, sort of a... cult.",
  "It wasn't intentional. It just sort of happened. Although... I have to admit it can be *useful*, occasionally.",
  "When the world started to change, it just didn't hit me and Melanie. Not, not really.",
  "We figured you'd know what was going on, so we headed for the Institute, but it was, um, well, you saw it up there. We couldn't find you, and by the time we arrived the world was full nightmare.",
  "No you didn't.",
  "How could we not? The entire city knows you were there.",
  "Always did enjoy being the centre of things.",
  "Not so fast. Is it safe? If we take you to the others, is that going to put them in danger?",
  "Fine. Come on then.",
  "Oh, and John?",
  "No tape recorders."
