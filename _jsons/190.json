  "No, I guess...",
  "Yes, alright, fine! Fine!",
  "Excuse me for caring.",
  "Has anyone been messing with the supplies?",
  "There's a tape recorder here.",

  "[Relieved] Oh thank god.",
  "Yeah. And they're with a couple of new people! I don't recognise them!",
  "[Whispered shout] Georgie! Melanie! Over here!",
  "[Plaintive] I'm allowed to care!",
  "Sorry, we haven't been introduced, you are...?",
  "Probably. The, um... place I was trapped in, they took my name. I never got it back. But I like Celia, so... yeah! Celia it is.",
  "So, where were you two then?",
  "They saved you, right? From one of the nightmares? So, what was it?",
  "[Embarrassed] Oh, um... they don't like it when you call them that.",
  "[Uncomfortable] Right.",
  "Oh, Georgie, I mean to -- Sorry, um, just --",

 "LAVERNE": [
  "They're fine. Sometimes they take a while. It's hardly the longest they've been gone, is it?",
  "Then how do you know what's too long?",
  "Celia... just trust them. \"They walk this world above the nightmare. It will not take them.\"",
  "Besides, you know that they sometimes go to a side tunnel for \"private contemplation\". I think it's sweet.",
  "Can they? There's not exactly many doors down here.",
  "And the tunnels do have a tendency to echo...",
  "We all care.",
  "I don't think so. Why do you ask?",
  "[Warily] Should there not be?",
  "Well, that explains it, doesn't it?",
  "Glad to see you're okay. We were getting worried.",
  "I think Arun's off writing. The rest are sleeping.",
  "Good to meet you.",
  "Celia, don't push. They can tell us when they're ready.",
  "No? So where did they come from?",
  "God, that sounds awful.",
  "Hang on... Sims...",
  "Melanie, this isn't your old boss?",
  "Small world... Nice to finally put a face to the name.",
  "Careful, she's very possessive of that chair.",
  "I just wanted to check if you were joining us for dinner?",
  "Cold baked beans.",
  "It's there if you want it.",
  "About them being chosen?",
  "Are you asking me personally, or do you want me to speak for the group?",
  "Hmm. Personally, I don't know what I believe. I saw Melanie every week for months, and if you'd asked if I thought she was a 'holy person', I'd have laughed. She always behaved understandably, even if her problems were sometimes... odd.",
  "It doesn't *need* to. Times like these, it just helps to believe. I'm not sure it really matters what."

  "[Faint, amused] First name terms with the prophets? Bit disrespectful.",

  "You can sleep here?",
  "Jonathan. John. Sims.",
  "Uh, right, okay. Well, um... We were... We're from out there. We've been wandering the world. Seeing all its horrors.",
  "But we're old friends of your... uh, prophets.",
  "Well, that's a fair point. I suppose, technically, 'saviours' would be the correct --",
  "I -- What?",
  "Oh. Oh! Oh, I suppose that makes sense.",
  "Georgie, it's not going to make a difference.",
  "Look, the tunnels offer some protection, but clearly not enough to stop whatever is manifesting these recorders. If you smash this one, they'll just make another one. Trust me on this, you need to let it go.",
  "I'm sorry. I didn't know.",
  "Not everything. Between the tunnels, and your and Melanie's... position relative to The Eye... I'm a bit in the dark here.",
  "I want you to accept that trying to stop them listening is only going to frustrate you.",
  "I promise... I promise that they're not here for you. They're here for me. And maybe a bit for Martin. They seem to like him.",
  "You had every right to.",
  "Georgie, you couldn't have stopped this, believe me.",
  "[Sigh] She's... not wrong.",
  "I was the catalyst. I-I didn't -- Elias -- Jonah Magnus used me.",
  "Oh. Good.",
  "So... this is it? You and Melanie sneak into nearby fearscapes, rescue someone and hide them here?",
  "And then you just... stay down here?",
  "I did wonder about the 'Ennui'-brand coke bottles.",
  "Georgie... Where's the Admiral?",
  "I don't know.",
  "I thought it was quite a good rhyme.",
  "Oh? No. That's not how it works.",

  "We didn't rescue them.",

  "Thank you Celia. Could you turn that off, please.",
  "[Brusquely] John, a word?",
  "Yeah, look and I understand that, but you've got to realise this isn't just --",
  "Oh, seriously? For fu--",
  "No, they can piss off! No! I refuse.",
  "I can do this all day!",
  "[Breathlessly] For god's sake!",
  "I'm not going to let us be spied on, John!",
  "There are seven with us now.",
  "[Sigh] It used to be more, a lot more. But... um, we got greedy, pulled too many out. We... attracted attention. And... well, now there are seven.",
  "Martin said you knew everything now.",
  "No pun intended.",
  "So what? You, just, want me to just leave the tapes running and hope?",
  "Just promise me these things aren't going to harm my people.",
  "That'll have to do, I guess.",
  "It's good to see you.",
  "I, um... I think I owe you an apology.",
  "I didn't realise how bad things were for, well, all of you. I mean, I kind of knew, but seeing all this for myself, I... I cut myself off and... I'm not so sure that was the right thing to do any more.",
  "Yeah, but it didn't exactly help, did it?",
  "Melanie reckons you're the reason... all this happened, whole apocalypse thing.",
  "Well, obviously. Even Melanie doesn't think you'd have been stupid enough to do this on purpose.",
  "Well, it's a bit more complicated than that, but... yeah, basically.",
  "These days, that's enough. We still need to eat sometimes, and drink. Found some supply caches down here --",
  "Yeah, that's, that's what Melanie said too.",
  "Also, uh, we found a pretty convenient nightmare that's essentially just an endless supermarket. Turns out if you take stuff from it, it stays pretty much fine. Not *nice*, y'know, but, y'know...",
  "Yeah, it's convenient, not subtle.",
  "[With difficulty] He's, uh... he's fine. I guess. He's enjoying himself, at least. He wasn't immune, not like me and Melanie. And he's a predator, pampered piece of fluff that he is.",
  "Turns out, there's a place full of cats. And their prey.",
  "I go to see him sometimes. I think he's happy, in his way. But, um... It's hard to see him like that. He didn't even know I was there.",
  "John... How do we turn it back?",
  "I don't think either of us is particularly comfortable with your use of the word \"redeemers\".",
  "Ah, no. He's... like us. Able to travel through the world.",
  "You didn't need to scare him like that.",
  "Look, we're all tired, and you still seem a little disoriented by the tunnels. Let's get some rest. We can talk about next moves tomorrow.",
  "We generally err on the side of caution and sleep in.",
  "Your tape's running again."

 "MELANIE": [
  "You don't have to, but it does pass the time.",
  "Yeah, I reckon it used to be a hideout of, um, you-know-who, uh, when he was living down here. It had supplies and everything.",
  "[Pointedly] Great question. John, do you want to field that one?",
  "[Emphatically] We haven't prophesied anything.",
  "Oh, shut up! John!",
  "I used to talk about you in therapy.",
  "Was that the recorder?",
  "It wasn't an accusation.",
  "That depends. Will it stay off?",
  "Then let it run. It's just the two of us, and it's not like we can attract any more attention to ourselves at this point, inviting the snoop-god's favourite kid down for a chat.",
  "And? I guess the end of the world must've left me all snappy.",
  "Don't. Don't say it. I actually did a lot of work on my anger, you know? Tried to put all the supernatural bollocks behind me. And now my therapist thinks I'm 'the chosen one'.",
  "Speaking of... uh, you and John, eh?",
  "Congrats, took you long enough.",
  "Yeah. Not... not since before John woke up.",
  "Before you, uh... cut yourself off.",
  "Look, I, I get it. I was still full of ghost bullet at the time, remember?",
  "[Playing along] Oh, um... [chuckle] I'm actually one of the prophets chosen to walk the end times unscathed.",
  "Oh, that... that sounds like a rough gig.",
  "Have you had to explain any of this stuff to somebody who just doesn't have the first clue about any of it?",
  "Yeah, well, tell you what, you sound like a doomsday-ing tarot reader.",
  "Hours talking about The Eye's 'ascendance', and how it's, y'know, transforming the world into a fearful 'psychoscape' and...",
  "Oh, I wish. No, they believed us, but a few of them took it in a bit more of a... religious direction. And here we are.",
  "Okay, um...I... [sigh] I said I'd had a vision that it would end.",
  "Look, I know, alright. [sigh] It was a shitty thing to do, but... if you had heard how, how hopeless they all were, like, when we told them all this. That everyone is trapped in, like, never-ending torment, forever... I had to tell them something.",
  "I hate it. They just keep trying to *interpret* everything I do. And they keep calling me \"The Blind Prophet\", which is a whole other thing!",
  "Yeah, uh-huh!",
  "It's why we head out so much. Sometimes we actually are scouting or gathering, but half the time... I just need to get away. If I didn't have Georgie, I think I might just snap and beat them all to death.",
  "[chuckle] Stop! We shouldn't talk about them like this. They, they are good people.",
  "It's just... hard not to look down on people when they put you up on a pedestal like that.",
  "Honestly? Er, well, these were not the early relationship hurdles I expected.",
  "But don't get me wrong... Georgie's incredible. Um, and she's, and she's far, far too good for me. And I, I only hope she doesn't realise that while there's an apocalypse on.",
  "And what about John?",
  "Modern dating, eh?",
  "Um... \u00a0Did you meet anyone else out there?",
  "Are -- Are they alright?",
  "Oh. Oh... Oh that's...",
  "Well, that, that makes sense. Although I'm not sure how much 'processing' she'll manage out there surrounded by -- Oh! Oh, I nearly forgot! Careful of Helen, if you see her. She turned up a while back and tried to eat Celia.",
  "Yes... a few times. Looking back, I was so stupid!",
  "Yes. Yes... \u00a0Honestly I had started to think she was on our side.",
  "Uh, sorry, what?!",
  "He can do that?",
  "Well. I mean that's... that's interesting to know. Ah --",
  "Oh, oh god, I forgot. I-I promised I'd listen to some of Arun's latest stuff.",
  "I wouldn't put you through that.",
  "[Quietly] I swear, if it's another hymn I am going to break something!",
  "[Awkward] Oh, okay, um... Right, so... Arun, I just think that the...",
  "[aside] Shut up, John!",

  "[Playfully] So... what do you do?",
  "Oh, I'm the antichrist's plus one.",
  "[Smiling] It has its perks.",
  "Seriously though, how the hell did you and Georgie fall into the 'prophet' thing.",
  "Yeah. It's the same outside London. Worse, in some places. Though I guess that's down to personal taste these days.",
  "Not often. And it never went great.",
  "They didn't believe you?",
  "Mmmm. Okay but I still don't get the whole 'prophet' business. What exactly are you meant to have predicted?",
  "Oh. Right. And er... *have* you had a vision or...",
  "Sounds like they'd probably thank you for your wisdom, if you did that.",
  "So how are you and Georgie doing?",
  "God, tell me about it.",
  "Oh, you know John. He's a complete mess. But, so am I and... I think we're making it work. Communication can be... difficult when you're on an unholy pilgrimage.",
  "Yeah, loads actually. In fact we... \u00a0we saw Basira and Daisy.",
  "No. Not really.",
  "Daisy had kind of gone full monster.",
  "And Basira kind of... had to kill her.",
  "Yeah. So, now Basira's on her way, but she's taking her own route. I think she needed some time to process.",
  "She was here?",
  "Because you kind of liked her?",
  "John killed her.",
  "Yeah, she tried to -- I wasn't there, but they got into a standoff and he... he destroyed her.",
