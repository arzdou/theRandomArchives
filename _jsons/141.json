  "Whenever you're ready.",
  "[Soothingly] You can go.",
  "Thank you Floyd. You've been... very helpful.",
  "It's alright, Floyd. You just... need a break.",
  "He had information about Salesa. I thought it would help.",
  "I wasn't sure. Just had a hunch there was something here.",
  "He didn't exactly seem inclined to volunteer the information. Besides, you said I needed to be ready for Ny-Alesund. \"Full power\" I believe were your words. The statement helped.",
  "Yes, Basira, he is. And I am sorry about that. But we needed it.",
  "Anyway you're the one who wants to be like Gertrude. You think she'd give a damn about a few bad dreams?",
  "No. She got the job done, and didn't care about the cost.",
  "I had to know, Basira.",
  "You could have stopped me.",
  "But you wanted to know as well, didn't you?.",
  "Get some rest. Two days yet."

  "And what, you thought the best way to find it was by... slurping it out of his brain?",
  "And now he's going to see you in his dreams as he relives that for the rest of his life. Because...",

  "Way the others talked about it, he'd been at this for a long time, decades at least, and when I sailed with him it was clear he knew exactly what he was doing. He was the only one ever allowed in the cargo bay during a voyage.",
  "This time, though... felt different. He was distant, quiet. His words, when he spoke to you at all, were blurred with alcohol and regret. Nobody knew what the plan was, so we just kept going.",
  "When it had finally subsided, and I could bring myself to look back, the island was gone and ocean was still.",
