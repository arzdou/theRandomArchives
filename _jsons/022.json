  "Recorded direct from subject, 12th March, 2016.",
  "Please stick to the statement, Martin.",
  "You're sure about all of this, Martin?",
  "You say you lost your phone two weeks ago?",
  "I just received another text message. From you. \"Keep him. We have had our fun. He will want to see it when the Archivist's crimson fate arrives.\"",
  "It means I ask Elias to hire some extra security. I should probably warn Sasha and Tim as well. I'll also have a look through the Archives, as I believe we should have a statement from Ms. Prentiss herself in here somewhere."

  "If you're that worried about it, it doesn't need to be an official statement. I just need a record of it.",
  "A close encounter with something I believe to have once been Jane... Prentiss.",
  "It wasn't a lot, really. Still, about as much as I might have expected, so I headed back to the Institute and updated you on what I'd found. And, well, as I'm sure you're aware that was the last time I saw you before I disappeared.",
  "If I ever see another can of peaches... [shudders]",
  "Look, I'm not going to lie to you about something like this, John. I... like my job. Most of the time.",
  "[Confused & flustered] Okay... thanks. To be honest I didn't, didn't expect you... to take it seriously.",
  "Thereabouts. When I went back to the basement.",
  "What does that mean?"
