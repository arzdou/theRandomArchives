  "You're sure I can't get you a cup of tea?",
  "Okay. You just seem a bit... jumpy, is all.",
  "Grand. Er, okay, what can I do for you?",
  "It's Mike, please.",
  "Oh, you, uh, yeah, you said.",
  "Oh. Statements of what?",
  "Hmm. Last chance for that cup of tea.",
  "And I was trying so hard to be polite.",
  "Maybe I'll let you live, allow you to drag yourself back down to your den, but... you need to learn some respect.",
  "I spent some time with a small grey volume, I think it was in Cyrillic, that decided it was at home amongst my bookshelves. I couldn't read it, of course, but... when it tried to read me back, I buried it on a lonely stretch of moorland.",
  "That's... that's all, I think. Since then I've embraced my new life; gladly fed that which feeds me.",
  "A... uh, a Paris skyscraper, was it you said? I honestly, I, I can't say I recall it in detail, but that does... sounds about right. Sometimes it's hard to keep track.",
  "Hm. You know, that was... that was nice. I'm not, not usually the sort for speeches. That was... pleasant change. So.",
  "Off you go, then.",
  "Archivist. Take my mercy and leave. You have touched something few ever walk away --",
  "I thought you said you came alone?",
  "Can I hel-- UGHH!"

 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "Uh, it-it's fine, really.",
  "Oh, I just, er... Coming in I thought... It's fine.",
  "Er... You're... you're Michael Crew, right?",
  "[Leadingly] I'm from the Magnus Institute.",
  "I, er... I read... You feature in some of our statements!",
  "You... There was, there was a book? Er, two of them, at least. Er... Ex Altiora, The Boneturner's Tale.",
  "You, uh, I think you threw a guy off a skyscraper in Paris.",
  "I... Where did you get that scar?",
  "[Breathing heavily] I, er... You --",
  "I... Er, no, I, I don't think so. Not anymore.",
  "Er, he... It feels like, he makes you... Vertigo. Like you're falling.",
  "Er, y-y-yes. Yes, a few, I think.",
  "I-I-I don't know.",
  "What are you --",
  "[Out of breath] So... so what now? You kill us?",
  "What? What, no --",
  "What, I? I, I didn't --",
  "Pl-please don't shoot me.",
  "Why are you doing this? Tell me!",
  "I'm sorry, I didn't --",
  "I didn't... I didn't kill anyone!",
  "I thi- I thi- I think it was Elias.",
  "I don't know. I, I could try.",
  "[Exhaling heavily] Yeah. Yeah.",
  "What about Mike?"
 ],
 "DAISY": [
  "Shut up. He human?",
  "Is this man human?",
  "Right. What does it do?",
  "Has he killed people?",
  "Does he need to see you to do it? Does he need to speak?",
  "Doubt he can do it in a coma. Now turn that off, and help me get him in the car. Don't try to run.",
  "What did I say about questions? I said turn that off!",
  "This is it.",
  "You think he's going to save you?",
  "Now... let's see the bag.",
  "One wallet, brown leather, no cash. One packet cigarettes, Silk Cut. One lighter, gold, spiderweb design. One pocket knife... blunt. Huh. One set of keys to the Magnus Institute. And one tape record-",
  "You sneaky little freak! You want to record this? Alright. I'd have to destroy it anyway.",
  "Stop... asking... questions!",
  "That's how you want it? Fine. You brought a knife. So we go through the voicebox.",
  "You been following me, Basira?",
  "He tell you?",
  "You don't know what he is. You don't know what it's like to have your secrets *pulled out* like teeth, just because he asked?",
  "Don't you... Don't you dare look at me like I'm crazy! It got you too, or do you think we gave him those tapes because we *like* handing out evidence?",
  "No? You ask me to take a tape over to this murdering freak, and I'm all set to tear you a new one for it. But then I get the cassette in my hand, and suddenly all I want to do is deliver his *tapes,* and spill my guts.",
  "First him, then his creepy boss.",
  "He murdered two people, Basira. Maybe more. I've done one monster today, no reason not to do another.",
  "Yeah. Well he's on my list too.",
  "He's got, he's got his own... He *knows* things. Would that work?",
  "Alright. But if this doesn't work, you're still dead.",
  "Grab a spade."

 "BASIRA": [
  "Daisy, put him down.",
  "Didn't need to. I know what you do here.",
  "He didn't need to. You're not that subtle. But I -- I always thought you just killed monsters.",
  "Just let him go.",
  "That's not how it happened.",
  "So, so now you kill him?",
  "This is too far, Daisy. You know it is.",
  "For god's sake look at him!",
  "What if he asks?",
  "You reckon he can mind control people. Make them tell the truth? Why not try it on Elias?",
  "Daisy! This might be our only chance to find out what's going on."
