  "Statement of Adelard Dekker, regarding a potential pandemic originating in the town of Klanxb\u00fcll, Germany. Original statement given 14th August, 2013. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, the Archivist.",
  "Once inside the town, it became rapidly apparent how bad the situation truly was. You and I, Gertrude, have seen more visions of hell than anyone has a right to while living, but this was something else entirely.",
  "I found the source of this sickness in the *parkplatz* opposite the train station. The cars had been pushed to the side, clearly at great cost to the bodies of those that pushed them, and in the center was a figure from whom the rot clearly flowed.",
  "It was then I gripped his hand and plunged the syringe into his spongy flesh, and pumped him full of the chemical cocktail. He staggered back, ripping the needle from my hand, and fell to the floor, shaking.",
  "But it did not seem quite right to leave without letting you know what happened, and Herr Becker was kind enough to succumb to the sickness without signing out of his computer. So.",
  "Goodbye, Gertrude. May you find your rest where no shadows are cast, and no eyes may see you slumber.",
  "I need someone I can trust.",
  "I just need to talk to --",
  "Look, is she here or not? She -- she said she was staying with you.",
  "Really? Where's all her stuff?",
  "No, I just...",
  "*Oh.* Oh I'm sorry, I didn't -- I didn't realize you were to-together.",
  "Please, Georgie, it's not -- I just need to know I'm not overreacting to something. I need an outside perspective.",
  "Yeah. It's me.",
  "I'm sorry, I just... it's Martin.",
  "No, you're right, I'm sorry. You alright?",
  "I need an ally.",
  "...I suppose not.",
  "Yeah.  Yeah, I am.",
  "Look after yourself. Both of you.",
  "I need -- you said before you knew the tunnels, right? That you'd been a... part of them?",
  "I need to know what's in there. What's at the center?  I-it's important, Martin -- I need to know.",
  "What? Why not?",
  "What? You -- you said you were going to help!",
  "I don't have time for this. *What is at the cen--*",
  "Fine. Can you take me there? To the center?",

  "That's 'cause it's none of your business. Now *leave*.",

  "It's -- it's okay. He's welcome... as a friend. But that's it.",

  "I honestly don't know. But I'm not inclined to risk it.",
