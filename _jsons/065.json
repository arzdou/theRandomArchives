  "Yes, I hear that a lot, too.",
  "Uh, look, I don't want to rush you --",
  "I mean, that's fascinating, Miss Winters, but I must politely ask you to start your statement.",
  "...traditionally, our concerns are with the particulars of the supernatural incident, its origins and manifestations.",
  "In that case, I still need to make the official notations.",
  "Statement of Tessa Winters, regarding a strange computer program she downloaded from the Deep Web three months ago.",
  "Is that accurate?",
  "Statement recorded direct from subject 7th January, 2017. Statement begins.",
  "I think... uh, yes. I think we do.",
  "Yes, I very much understand.",
  "Oh! While I have you --",
  "It looks like my posting on a few of the more tech-savvy boards appealing for statements has worked.",
  "I'm almost afraid --",
  "No, what did you say?",
  "There's no need for the attitude, I know things have been difficult --",
  "It just seems a little too convenient.",
  "Yes, I know, I know Elias's whole spiel about signal degradation and installation issues, but I don't buy it. I mean, he got the CO2 system put in easily enough --",
  "Now, listen here --",
  "Well, excuse me if my experiences have made --",
  "Well, what do you want, you want sympathy?",
  "Jane Prentiss was *not* my fault, I did *not* bring her to the archive --",
  "Well, what would you have me do?!",
  "Well, Elias --",
  "Then quit. If you hate it so much, leave your post in the Archives. Permanently.",
  "I'm offering you a chance to quit. No notice period, I'll even make sure you get the rest of the month's paycheck.",
  "Just say the words.",
  "So do it.",
  "I-I don't know, but I don't think I can fire you either.",
  "It's this place.",
  "For now? I suppose we just... do our jobs.",
  "I suppose so."

  "Yeah, just... your tape recorder. It's old.",
  "I just mean, I've been thinking about \"analog\" and \"digital,\" what we mean by them?",
  "Yeah. We use the word \"digital\" to refer to one specific way of storing information, discrete signal values interpreted at pre-established levels. \"Analog\" is just a fancy way of saying \"everything else.\"",
  "[speaking over him] Almost everything in the world is analog, but we're obsessed with digital. We try to surrender everything into it, break the world down and turn it into as much binary as it takes. But it's not the same.",
  "I used to work on OCR programs, teaching computers to read, to take the messy physicality of the written word and convert it into something that a computer can understand in a digital format.",
  "Or maybe deep down somewhere inside, you understand what's happening to you and -- no. I am, I don't know which scares me more.",
  "What do you think I've been doing?",
  "I'm giving you context.",
  "Have you ever heard of Sergey Ushanka? I'd guess not. He's one of the less well-known online spook stories, and you don't look like you're a regular presence in the chatbot or neural net communities.",
  "Well, according to the story, he, he got sick. In most versions it's, uh, it's brain cancer, but some say early-onset Alzheimer's, or some sort of undiagnosed brain infection. Point is, it was killing him, and it affected his brain.",
  "Now, Sergey didn't want to die, the idea of death terrified him, and whatever was eating his mind gave him the idea to try and save his consciousness, to, um, to upload his brain.",
  "Well, the next bit, it, um, depends on how ghoulish a version of the story you're told.",
  "In some, he spends a fortune and every last hour his last month's trying desperately to code his own mind into his system, and he ends up lying dead at the keyboard, decomposing fingers still tapping away the last slivers of himself.",
  "Whatever version you're told, the story goes that it actually worked, and the police found a pile of floppy disks full of impossible code next to the mutilated body of Sergey Ushanka.",
  "I wasn't exactly sure what to do, as usually, the bot would make the first move, so I decided to go with a generic hello. There was no way the bots didn't have a response programmed for that.",
  "It's gibberish -- just a mess of symbols and letters, like it was using the wrong characters. Some of them weren't even ASCII. I didn't have time to really process it, though, as they were generating quickly, and soon filled the whole screen.",
  "They weren't static, either, but changing and scrolling, and um, and it's gonna sound weird and it was only for a moment, but I could have sworn I saw some of the symbols twitch? Like they were in pain?",
  "It was making my eyes hurt to watch, and I started to feel dizzy... but I couldn't bring myself to look away.",
  "My mouth was dry, and my hands were shaking, but even then all I could think was [laugh] how *good* this was. I was genuinely impressed by how unsettled it was making me.",
  "Sure enough, the lights went dark, and the groaning sounds of the fan died, but the white text on the screen wasn't going anywhere.",
  "More words popped in and out of existence: \"you wanted to talk\" and \"hihihihihi\" over and over again.",
  "All the time I was trying to figure this out, the video kept playing. The man's breathing was labored and painful, and he was talking, muttering to himself, or maybe to me. There was no way to tell.",
  "He said that a lot. \"It's cold\" and \"it hurts.\"",
  "That video was 17 hours long. I know this because it followed me until I watched all of it.",
  "I tried to show it to a friend once, but he just looked at me like I was playing some weird joke. Only I could see it, apparently. I don't want to be mad. I don't think I am. But there's no way really to know, is there?",
  "After a month of this, I finally sat down and watched it through to the end. It was the longest day of my life, and by the end, I felt so very sick, I almost threw up when he smiled. Finally, he laid down in front of the camera and said:",
  "\"The maze is sharp on my mind.\"",
  "\"The angles cut me when I try to think.\"",
  "Then he stopped moving. I could see the top of his head then, and the back of it seemed to be missing.",
  "The picture stayed like that for about half an hour, and then the video ended. I haven't seen it since.",
  "It must hurt. Though not a sort of pain that we can understand.",
  "Is that enough? Do you have what you need?",
  "The way you're looking at me, I'm going to assume you don't know anything more about this than I do.",
  "Yeah, I figured. I just saw your post and thought, why not? And it does feel good to talk about it. You know?"

  "I said --",
  "Oh, they have, have they? \"Things have been difficult!\"",
  "You've spent a month staring at that footage, double-checking every moment, timing every tea break, looking at me like I somehow staged it, but no you're right. \"Things have been difficult.\"",
  "Just stop talking, I'm sick of this, I'm sick of you. we didn't kill Gertrude, and no one wants to kill you, you pompous idiot.",
  "Elias doesn't care, Martin just wants a tea party, and Sasha -- and you -- you're treating me like I'm somehow to blame for it all, like I didn't suffer the worst right alongside you.",
  "*Your* experiences? *Fuck* you, I got eaten by worms because of you!",
  "You know what, yeah! Little bit of basic sympathy would have been nice!",
  "Ohhh, but you went off the deep end afterwards, didn't you? Everything went to hell. When you actually needed to be in charge, you just hid down here and played with your tape re--",
  "Anything! Anything that wasn't turning into a paranoid lunatic would have been fine! Anything that showed you could actually do your job!",
  "Elias should've fired you weeks ago.",
  "After everything you've pulled, you should be gone. But no! Instead, we all get to talk about how *you're* feeling, because we're *worried* about our *stalker boss.* I, I can't do this anymore!",
  "You're firing me?",
  "I want to...",
  "I, I *can't!* I don't know -- *why* can't I quit?!",
