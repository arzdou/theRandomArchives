  "She says the same as you. Two men, doesn't know how they got in, too intimidated to ask, looked \"exactly like you'd expect\". Useless...",
  "Elias told me the same thing. Luckily he phrased it as advice rather than an instruction, so for now I'm more inclined to keep studying it. We're not in the business of destroying knowledge.",
  "Yes, go on.",
  "Waste of tape, really. He's right. Might as well get some use out of it.",

  "Now there's only one thing I have left that I value. That I love. And I cannot lose him. I can't lose Ethan. I shouldn't be in this mess. It's absurd. I didn't do anything wrong. I just dropped a bottle. That's all! I don't deserve this. I don't."

  "I didn't see the table. I guess Rosie must have signed for it. I mean, it's her office on the way to Artefact Storage, that makes sense.",
  "Sorry... Look, John, I do think we should destroy the table, though. I mean, if it's the one from Amy Patel's statement. Just in case.",
  "I suppose. Can I go now?",
  "Look, you need to get some sleep.",
  "I'll see you later."
