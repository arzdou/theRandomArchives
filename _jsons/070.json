  "Statement of Masato Murray, regarding an unusual inheritance and the causes thereof. Original Statement given 9th December, 2003. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "> \"Life is a current which cannot be fought. It is a march with one destination. You cannot cease your step, nor move your course, to one that skirts the journey's termination.\"",
  "And below it, in a faded blue ink was a handwritten message:",
  "> \"YOU HAVE ALREADY READ TOO MUCH\"",
  "I've discouraged further attempts to locate Mr. Murray, as even the latest of his possible ends was some years ago now, and if he was in any way correct about the book, he is most likely long dead.",
  "Notable in his account, however, is the absence of any indication that this book was ever possessed by Jurgen Leitner. It seems to support the theory that, whatever these books are, Leitner is not entirely responsible for them.",
  "There was only one scrap large enough to decipher anything legible: \"They have for adversaries the Satariel, or concealers, the Demons of absurdity, of intellectual inertia, and of Mystery.\""
