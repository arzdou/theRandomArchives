  "Still with me?",
  "Some fears don't need to be intensified.",
  "It's a maze in there -- deliberately so.",
  "People running, desperately struggling for fire escapes only to find them blocked.",
  "We won't get lost, though.",
  "I know the route.",
  "Yes, it is.",
  "It'll be fine.",
  "It can't do us any permanent harm -- once we're out, we'll be fine.",
  "Yes, I know, okay!",
  "I'll take us through the parts that are more.",
  "It goes in phases; sometimes there are whole apartments that aren't actively on fire for.",
  "Well, it's the best I can do!",
  "I mean -- sort of?",
  "This is where Jude Perry rules.",
  "He's here; he has a part of it, but it's.",
  "Bigger than you could believe.",
  "There's *so much* fear in there.",
  "You said you were onboard.",
  "It wouldn't hurt?",
  "Is that -- a joke?",
  "If you really don't want to do this, w-we can go another way.",
  "Well, let's just say you're more important.",
  "Like I said, I can't see the future.",
  "It wouldn't *free* them, if that's what you're asking.",
  "'Free' doesn't really exist in this place.",
  "So are we going in or not?",
  "I should have told you before, so -- I leave the decision to you.",
  "You know my feelings on the matter.",
  "I -- Oh, right: I want revenge on Jude Perry.",
  "I want to.",
  "Make her feel what --  What all her victims felt.",
  "But I'm not willing to force you to suffer for it.",
  "Or we could sit here.",
  "We go in.",
  "We'll be fine.",
  "Such a simple word.",
  "Home -- not *house,* not *dwelling*, not *residence* or *address*, not *domicile* or *flat* or *lodging* or *abode* or *apartment* or *property* or *accommodation*.",
  "A structure of brick or wood or concrete or canvas.",
  "A box in which you pack yourself away when the long day is done.",
  "A book neatly closed and placed snugly on a shelf.",
  "There's no place like home.",
  "An Englishman's home is his castle.",
  "Home is where the heart is.",
  "And home is where that heart can be hurt most severely, because within that place of safety, the warm and welcoming embrace of the cramped and well-trod floors whose layout has ingrained itself into your *soul*, there you are most vulnerable.",
  "Your home is an extension of yourself, as much as you will let it be, and the place and the people and the things that form it and fill it are as much a part of you as your blood.",
  "As your bile.",
  "As your tears.",
  "Perhaps you know the feeling that comes rushing over you when your home is compromised, invaded, corrupted.",
  "Perhaps a burglary gives lie to the promise of safety you took from a flimsy front door and a cheap lock.",
  "You may even find yourself living with a hostile, toxic presence, whether they be family, friend, or stranger, that poisons your home, turning blessed relief and rest from the tribulations of the world into a choking fog of anxiety and fear.",
  "Such are the dangers of a rotten home.",
  "But how many truly control their home?",
  "How many have extended their soul into the walls of a place that exists only at the whim of those who would let them die in the street were it not for the gain that can be squeezed from them.",
  "A home that you can not control, that you cannot even be sure will exist with the turning of the seasons.",
  "Where stability and peace rot in calamity, exist only at the behest of faceless names that lace themselves throughout labyrinthine paperwork, chaining you to the front of a truck whose motion you cannot control.",
  "Do you smell smoke?",
  "Do you smell the creeping ruin of a life, a stalking creature of unmaintained electricals, of cheap insulation, of cutting corners and missing fire alarms and unenforced safety regulations?",
  "Can you hear the crackling promise of kindled despair that it whispers into your uneasy, dreaming ear?",
  "Sabina senses it, feels it drawing near.",
  "How long has she lived here?",
  "How long have these cramped, dingy rooms in the back of this -- sprawling rundown tenement been the place her heart calls home?",
  "She cannot recall, but long enough for her to grow into love for it, to cherish every rusted appliance, every crumbling piece of plasterboard, every flickering lightbulb.",
  "Even as the widening cracks and spreading mold fill her heart with dread, they gently, slowly, inch by inch approach the room where her parents lie sleeping.",
  "Sabina -- cannot picture their faces, but knows that should they wake to see the state of the place, their anger would be blistering.",
  "She sits there on the ratty, torn sofa, trying to bring herself to stand up, to *do* something about the place that is crumbling around her.",
  "But she is locked there by the sure knowledge that anything she touches could result in the loss of any small stability she has.",
  "She barely notices how hot her tears are becoming.",
  "Which sense is the first to warn her?",
  "What nerves are the first ones to fire the white-hot bolts of agonizing panic through Sabina's body?",
  "Does she smell it, the rising smoke?",
  "A slow and subtle scent, like someone's burned their toast, and -- is that hair?",
  "Does she hear it, the distant roaring, like the soft growl of a lion who never stops approaching, spotted with shrieks and screams that might just be her imagination?",
  "Does she see it, the glow of the flames, pulsing slow and steady, the dull orange of old streetlights, but somehow strong enough to push through the cracks around the front door?",
  "Does she feel it, the rising prickly heat, like she has sat too close to an electric radiator for too long, and her skin has begun to redden and blossom before the bars into thick beads of sweat?",
  "Or does she taste it in the back of her throat, the sick, queasy terror that tells her she knows *exactly* what is coming.",
  "Because it's all happened before.",
  "Once again, the handle of the front door begins to glow red-hot, the metal bending and distorting as it melts.",
  "From the crack underneath, the fire drags itself forward, curling and caressing the rough coir of the mat that cheerily announced *'Welcome Home!",
  "Its movements are flickering, rhythmic, almost hypnotic, and as her mind *screams* at her to stand, to run, to escape, she simply sits there, eyes locked on the dancing lights emerging around her front door.",
  "She smiles the same smile she did when she was a child, staring at the bonfire at camp, though every nerve in her body is alight with fear.",
  "Then the welcome mat ignites completely, in an instant turning from a gentle smoulder to a gout of flame, and whatever strange compulsion holds her in place snaps like a wire cable.",
  "She leaps to her feet and starts screaming, calling for help for her parents.",
  "She runs to the door to their room but as she approaches she can already feel the heat wafting out from behind it.",
  "She can hear them crying out in agony, begging for her to save them as their pain crescendos.",
  "She can smell the oily reek of charred skin as they call to her: *\"We're burning!",
  "Oh please, god, Sabina; we're* burnin*g\"!",
  "She grabs the handle, ignoring the sizzling of her own flesh and pushing through the lancing needles of torment to force it down, trying to free her unseen parents.",
  "But the door latch never really aligned properly, you see.",
  "The landlord always said he was going to get it fixed, and -- it refuses to open.",
  "Sabina pounds helplessly on the smoking wood as the voices of her parents go quiet.",
  "Pushing down a grief that threatens to overwhelm her senses, she charges to the window, rushing to reach the old fire escape beyond.",
  "The window frame never really opened properly, you see.",
  "The landlord always said he was going to get it fixed.",
  "And it judders as she tries to force it open, freezing a few inches from the bottom.",
  "Sabina pushes all her might into it but the glass cracks and shatters, peppering her with razor-sharp shards, cutting her face to ribbons.",
  "She stumbles, trying to climb through the jagged window regardless, and she can feel the cool iron of the fire escape, a moment of blessed relief that shines through her suffering.",
  "But the fire escape was always really rusty, you see.",
  "The landlord always said he was going to replace it.",
  "And at the first tiny bit of weight she puts upon it, she can feel the fastenings pop out of the old brick one by one, and her salvation tumbles away into the impossible distance below.",
  "What floor was her flat on again?",
  "Surely it can't be this high.",
  "Falling back into the inferno that is now her home, Sabina dashes over to the laughably small fire extinguisher the landlord begrudgingly provided.",
  "It is sputtering and empty.",
  "She runs to the sink, to the tap that has always made that unpleasant grinding sound, and turning it, unleashes only a slow trickle of a thick, dark, oozing substance that smells faintly of *gas*.",
  "Limping and desperate, she turns to see her furniture in flames, the bookshelves full of memories that she can't quite place but *knows* are precious to her curl and float away as ash.",
  "-- pops out of the frame.",
  "Naturally, we came to see you.",
  "I have a question for you.",
  "I've been wondering: did you know what you were doing?",
  "When you burned me.",
  "Marked me with.",
  "Did you know it would lead to -- all this?",
  "Answer the question.",
  "Because I want to hear you say it.",
  "Just answer the damn question!",
  "So why did you do it?",
  "And if you had?",
  "I suppose you're right.",
  "Leave him alone.",
  "I can feel the pain of every person you have trapped here.",
  "My own isn't all that different.",
  "I wouldn't worry about that: I'm *right where I want to be*.",
  "I'm here for you, Jude.",
  "To end you.",
  "You know I'm not.",
  "You're already afraid.",
  "I'd have thought that was a mindset you would appreciate.",
  "Now, *feel* it.",
  "All the terror and pain you've inflicted.",
  "You shouldn't have.",
  "I suppose not."

  "Are we even going to be able to make it through all that?",
  "not really what I was getting at, John.",
  "-- it's a burning.",
  "That's on *fire!",
  "You are aware that traditionally, wading into a flaming inferno is actually considered bad for your health!",
  "Alright, I just wanted to check.",
  "We're planning to go through.",
  "all this, so I'm guessing the fire can't actually burn us!",
  "Well, if you want me to go in there with you, then I suggest you find a way to make it -- simple!",
  "Yes or no, can that fire hurt us?",
  "*Will* the fire feel hot to me?",
  "Will it cause me lots of pain if I touch it?",
  "Will it *burn me alive* and kill me dead*?",
  "You're sure there isn't another way?",
  "Yeah, I know, *the journey will be the journey*, blah blah ominous blah.",
  "I know you wouldn't take me through if we didn't actually need to *go* through, so.",
  "John, is there another way?",
  "You -- You took a hard turn after the roots back there; I *knew* that was a thing!",
  "Why are we here?",
  "John, why have you taken us here?",
  "That's the one who burned your hand, isn't it?",
  "I just assumed it would be.",
  "who was that landlord guy?",
  "But we're not going after him, are we.",
  "That we'd be *safe.",
  "I know, okay, I just --  Look, I j,just -- don't want to get burned, all right?",
  "It's, it's like my *least* favorite pain ever.",
  "No, no, okay?",
  "I, I legitimately hate burns, alright?",
  "They're, they're *awful*, and they *scar horribly*, and they just -- it -- it just makes me sick; I, I hate it.",
  "It's not just your revenge though, is it?",
  "it would help all those people in there, wouldn't it?",
  "Apart from us.",
  "Okay, let's, let's not dive into another -- ontological debate right now.",
  "You're -- I, you're asking me?",
  "So it's --  *I* have to choose, do I?",
  "No, I'm not going to choose; I don't, I don't think that's a fair decision to put on me.",
  "It's *your* revenge; *your* choice, not mine.",
  "J-- Lead the way.",
  "John, you idiot!",
  "Please go back!",
  "John, look out!",
  "Just DIE already!",
  "The fires are still here.",
  "Doesn't look like much has changed.",
  "Let's just get out of here."
