 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "Statement of Staff Sergeant Clarence Berry, regarding his time serving with Wilfred Owen in the Great War. Original statement given November 6th, 1922. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "It struck me that perhaps he was describing some dreadful mirage that had come upon him as he lay in that wretched place, and I asked him to tell me what the war looked like.",
  "It was told to me later that it was on that day the first overtures of peace were made between the nations, and the Armistice was signed almost exactly a week later. We were shipped home soon after.",
  "Still, an interesting enough tale, and I feel like I recognise the name 'Joseph Rayner' from somewhere, though for the life of me I couldn't say where. I've had the case returned to its proper location in the archives."
