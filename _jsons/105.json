  "I, I don't, why?",
  "Uh, about two years now.",

  "I will. Thank you.",
  "[Sigh] Maybe this is pointless. I should head home, help the others in their research. If I knew Mandarin or Cantonese, maybe I could look here for more answers, but as it is these files...",
  "Hang on, I think... I think this says 2004. Yes, 1992... 1997... 2004. If I'm reading this right, this file hasn't been accessed for... wait. Ohhhh...",
  "So it's been a waste of time then, has it?",
  "I mean, in 2004, yes, but I-I need information about her visit three years ago. Did, did your assistant find anything about that?",
  "A-and can I read them?",
  "[Sigh] Well, Wh-what happened to them? Where are they?",
  "Gertrude asked for them t-to, to be sent to her?",
  "To the Institute or...?",
  "Oh. Oh, would you still have a-a copy of the address?",
  "Thank you, Xiaoling."
