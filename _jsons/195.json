 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "[Weary] Come on.",
  "How much further can it be?",
  "Down in the depths, there is a cold beyond cold.",
  "An icy, liquid chill that surrounds you, embraces you, pierces every inch of your naked gooseflesh skin with its needling touch, and gets inside your bones, the marrow frozen into nothing but agony.",
  "The shivers that wrack your body are so intense that when you stretch your arms or kick your legs to swim, their movements are wild, uncontrolled, pushing you through the water in shuddering bursts.",
  "Yes, you remember.",
  "The darkness around you, the forever of it all.",
  "Sometimes you forget just what it is that keeps you gripped so tight, suspended in place above nothing.",
  "But the thought comes to you quick enough when your lungs begin to burn.",
  "When did you last breathe?",
  "How much longer can you hold out?",
  "You consider for a moment opening yourself, simply letting it in, drowning.",
  "What are you so afraid of?",
  "But you know there is no release in it.",
  "You have been drowning as long as you can remember, and to invite the impossible cold into yourself, through your lungs and into your core, will bring no end to it, no relief.",
  "So you hold on.",
  "You hold out as long as you can, ignoring the agony, straining against the pressing darkness that has consumed you, and that implores you to consume it in return.",
  "There is air above you.",
  "You know that.",
  "Far, far above is the surface, the inky stillness of that silent barrier between water and sky, motionless as black glass, an obsidian expanse that stretches away.",
  "You could break that stillness, shatter its peace as you emerge, clawing, spluttering into the air.",
  "But the idea repels you.",
  "Your heart seizes at the thought, and your blood shoots through with a cold that has nothing to do with the water.",
  "Why does your mind recoil and beg you to stay down, to hold fast in the darkness, to simply keep drowning?",
  "Just swim, that's the key.",
  "Pick a direction, and swim until you find something.",
  "Land perhaps, or just another who is suffering as you are.",
  "Were you doing that already?",
  "Which way have you been going?",
  "The shivers that pass convulsively through your body make it so hard to tell for sure, and no light will condescend to reach down here.",
  "But still you press on, try to keep moving through the pain, through the fear that attempts to paralyse you, to lock you in place as surely as the water that presses all around.",
  "How long have you been moving now?",
  "Your lungs still burn and beg you to succumb.",
  "Something deep and old, and larger than your frostbitten imagination can conceive.",
  "You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, but you feel it.",
  "The water shifts and pushes against you, spinning you around, and tearing apart your thin idea of up and down.",
  "It is coming closer, its smooth motion relentless as an iron bell tolling in the silence.",
  "It is close.",
  "It is here.",
  "You can feel its titanic bulk moving past, just below you.",
  "Or perhaps above.",
  "It almost brushes against you and, despite the pressure of the water all around you, you cannot fight the frantic instinct to run.",
  "There is no pain, simply a wave of sickened nausea that passes up through your legs and into your stomach.",
  "You keep moving, limbs splaying in that strange pseudo-run, moving along it, and begging for this thing to end.",
  "Sometimes your feet do not land upon its skin, but press on something else.",
  "Something smooth and hard that feels like bone.",
  "And then it is gone, passed away from you, and out into the expanse of dark and quiet cold.",
  "You cannot stay down here.",
  "The darkness hides terrible things, and your whole chest screams for air.",
  "You take a moment and focus, concentrate on the feeling of the water around you, the gentle pull that promises to be down, and then you begin to swim, a desperate crawl up through the black towards the vague hope of a surface.",
  "You do not know how long you have been swimming, how far you have climbed, but when you thrust your hand forward you feel something change.",
  "It is a sudden release, a weightless freedom that seems so alien to you now.",
  "A new panic begins to overtake you, but it is too late, as your whole body rips through the unbroken surface of the sea and into open air.",
  "You feel dark water explode from your throat in something that is half-screaming, half-disgorging foul and icy liquid, and you take a breath.",
  "The air burns, perhaps a new feeling, or perhaps one long forgotten, and you open your eyes.",
  "You look around you, neck twisting violently, trying to take it all in, but the ocean that stretches away is smooth against the reddened sky, unchanging.",
  "There is nothing else.",
  "No boat to save you, no land to make your escape, not even another lost soul who shares your torments.",
  "Deep down, in the icy depths, you could imagine.",
  "you could hope.",
  "The darkness hides terrible things, but it could also hide salvation.",
  "You cannot know what is down there, but up here it is laid out in such terrible stark detail that there is nothing.",
  "You only know you are crying because the water on your face is warm enough that it feels like fire upon your cheek.",
  "And beyond that, up in the sky you feel it.",
  "Looking down on you in something approaching delight, drinking in your despair and bitter dread.",
  "Enjoying your misery and terror as you cast about for something that might be hope.",
  "It disgusts you, the waves of smug satisfaction that pervade your being as it stares at you.",
  "You cannot bear for it to see you like this.",
  "It makes you want to scream, but you know your screams are exactly what it wants.",
  "You choke it down, and slip once again below the surface.",
  "Into the concealing darkness of the freezing waters below, and you leave behind the nothing that waits above.",
  "Well, not quite nothing.",
  "Not for me.",
  "[Softly] There you are.",
  "[Calling] Need a ride?",
  "Oh, uh, you're welcome?",
  "I was worried you might be upset if I interrupted your whole 'solo reflection' thing.",
  "Glad I could oblige.",
  "I need your help.",
  "Annabelle Cane has Martin.",
  "I think she's taking him to Hill Top Road, and.",
  "Oh, uh, y-yes, I, um.",
  "A-Annabelle has a -- Sh-She can block The Eye.",
  "There's a, a camera.",
  "It's an artefact that was protecting Salesa's -- Right.",
  "[Irritated] I'm not messing ar-- Right.",
  "That would not have been a good idea.",
  "That's because there wasn't one.",
  "That makes two of us.",
  "[Weary] Maybe it just represents the feeling of sore arms.",
  "Hard to say.",
  "Certainly feels that way.",
  "I'm trying to think of it as a metaphor.",
  "Not at all.",
  "I'd be more than happy to let you take over, if you'd like?",
  "At this point, that's just about the only part of me that isn't cramping.",
  "Here you go.",
  "No, it's -- I could look at it, but it.",
  "it was like a..",
  "You know that feeling you get when you look down from a, a great height, like you're being pulled into the abyss?",
  "[Getting lost in thought] Well it was.",
  "was like that.",
  "Normally I can see it, see the.",
  "webs, and feel the power of The Spider emanating from it, but.",
  "as I would look.",
  "it's like my mind.",
  "the strands going down and.",
  "[Catching self] It's quite disorientating.",
  "Either way the important thing is that right now, I can't see it at all.",
  "Old times wasn't actually all that long ago.",
  "Well, hopefully this one will go a bit better.",
  "how was the trip down?",
  "How are you doing?",
  "We're still here.",
  "I think you might have effectively inherited Daisy's role.",
  "That's very much The Hunt's thing, isn't it?",
  "You kill, and then you become?",
  "What I mean is, Daisy moved through the domains, tormenting you with the chase, but also spreading fear wherever she went, and watching the results with hungry eyes.",
  "I think that's what you're doing now: travelling through, seeing places, and feeding The Eye with your observations.",
  "And your revulsions.",
  "If you like.",
  "You'll probably end up with your own domain, eventually.",
  "And there it is.",
  "Uh, they found me.",
  "I don't know what you mean.",
  "I said it was plausible.",
  "You were right.",
  "What do you mean?",
  "I mean, probably.",
  "But, y'know, well, I can't see them, can I?",
  "I also killed Helen.",
  "She was dangerous.",
  "And not like the others out there.",
  "Well, I haven't told her yet.",
  "So, I suppose I have that to look forward to when we get back.",
  "That's not the part I'm worried about.",
  "I wouldn't want to cramp your style.",
  "we're almost there.",
  "Would it make you feel better to know that it's not technically real?",
  "Look, it's fine.",
  "We probably won't even be coming back this way.",
  "They all seemed fairly normal given the circumstances.",
  "Bit of a let-down in some ways.",
  "Worship is maybe a bit strong.",
  "And that's the issue.",
  "I'd say it's as culty as it can be, when the 'leaders' are actively trying to stop it.",
  "We've entered the, uh.",
  "Sorry, I should have said.",
  "The camera, it.",
  "it blocks my connection, and I, uh.",
  "It doesn't matter.",
  "Martin's here, and we need to find him.",
  "I, I, I don't know.",
  "It's not exactly breadcrumbs but, uh.",
  "[Resolute] I'll be fine."

 "BASIRA": [
  "How did you find me?",
  "I mean, I would have at first but.",
  "There are a bunch more hells between me and London than I thought.",
  "I've been hoping for a friendly face for a while now.",
  "Not that I couldn't make it on my own.",
  "You're not here to just give me a lift are you?",
  "You need my help?",
  "I thought you were basically a god now?",
  "Oh, it's, it's fine, you can catch me up later.",
  "Let's focus on the Martin situation.",
  "Can you, y'know, 'see' him?",
  "Magic camera that keeps them hidden.",
  "So they're at Hill Top Road?",
  "And you're sure?",
  "Even if you can't see them?",
  "And you know the way?",
  "So what are we waiting for?",
  "Stop messing around, let's go.",
  "It's lucky for me you needed help.",
  "I just got out of this weird mirror-maze thing, and then I was just.",
  "on an island.",
  "I was seriously considering swimming.",
  "I don't remember there being a huge lake between London and Oxford.",
  "I'm a bit over the whole horror-geography thing at this point.",
  "So I'm guessing it represents academic isolation or something?",
  "Maybe something to do with 'the dangerous unknown', skimming to the surface, that kind of thing?",
  "Been rowing a while, then?",
  "Yeah, you look like crap.",
  "And that helps?",
  "No, I wouldn't want to cramp your style.",
  "Alright, give 'em here.",
  "what do we know about Hill Top Road?",
  "Another blind spot?",
  "It's like a..",
  "a Web-Vast team-up?",
  "So we know they're there with the magic camera.",
  "[Sighs] And we're charging off into the unknown again?",
  "It's just like old times.",
  "Feels it, though doesn't it?",
  "Would be hard for it to go worse.",
  "But I think I'm doing better having done it.",
  "I always used to think I was helping people get what they deserved you know?",
  "But then you see people suffering like this, with their deepest fears everywhere, and it's people who I'd say were good people, or bad people or.",
  "And there are avatars, jailors and torturers, and some of them seem to hate it as much as the people they're guarding.",
  "But they still do it.",
  "I don't know.",
  "I guess it's.",
  "It's hard to look back on what I did as all that different.",
  "[Bitter laugh] Bit late for self-discovery though, right?",
  "After the world's ended?",
  "But I don't really know what I even am anymore?",
  "Am I an avatar, or what?",
  "[Exhales] So I'm what?",
  "Just a freelance watcher?",
  "But if it's The Hunt, what am I supposed to be chasing?",
  "So catch me up.",
  "What's been happening?",
  "You found Melanie and Georgie?",
  "So I was right, then?",
  "Yeah, you do.",
  "Just after that meat factory, we were talking, and I said maybe you couldn't see them because Georgie couldn't feel fear and Melanie had cut herself off from The Eye.",
  "Yeah, but you did the face when you said it.",
  "So does this mean there are others?",
  "Like, they can't be the only ones like that, right?",
  "Maybe there are other people out there, naturally immune, wandering around or hunkered down?",
  "Didn't expect that.",
  "No, no, I get it.",
  "Honestly, it's kind of a relief.",
  "How did Melanie take it?",
  "She and Helen were pretty tight back when, uh.",
  "Back when you were in your coma.",
  "If we get back.",
  "He'll be okay.",
  "I know a good way to take your mind off it.",
  "So we're just gonna leave the boat?",
  "If you say so.",
  "So anyway, run this by me again, they're like a proper cult, cult?",
  "But like, they actually worship Melanie and Georgie?",
  "[Laughs] Melanie must hate that.",
  "Hang on, is that -- ?",
