  "I've, uh, just touched her in O'Hare International Airport, following up on the address I received from Xiaoling.",
  "Apparently they were staying in West Pullman, Chicago. At least, they were when Gertrude requested the statements forwarded on to them. I'm going to get a hotel and follow up the address tomorrow.",
  "I wouldn't normally bother recording here, but I think... I thought I was being followed.",
  "I might just be jumpy. I'll keep my eyes peeled.",
  "The address didn't really pan out. The place deals in short-term rentals, and a dozen people must have gone through that apartment since Gertrude and Gerard stayed there.",
  "I asked him about circuses around at the time, and he said he didn't *remember* there being one, but a few nights while Gertrude was there, he *had* heard music -- \"like one of those little organs\" -- coming from West Pullman Park.",
  "I'm planning to make the journey down to Washington in the hopes that Gertrude might have visited the Usher Foundation. According to our earlier emails, they don't have any record of it on file, but...",
  "Also, I'm *definitely* being followed.",
  "There's a police officer, I saw him at the airport as well, he stood out a bit because he wasn't immigration, or TSA or anything like that. He just, he just looked like a Chicago beat cop.",
  "Well, I saw him again today. And I'm pretty sure he was watching me.",
  "The, the hospital was, the hospital was interesting. It's all very well being able to get people to answer your questions, but if they genuinely don't remember something, it's not always as useful as it seems.",
  "Unless he was somehow able to lie to me this nurse, Louis, honestly believes Gerard Keay is dead.  Maybe I came all this way for nothing.",
  "I need some sleep.",
  "I haven't seen a cop since I left Chicago, so maybe I was wrong.",
  "I'm not feeling so good.",
  "I've been looking into Gertrude's arrest. I couldn't get through to Melanie, but Martin managed to find a few details online.",
  "They'd been unable to determine if the mutilations on Gerard's body had been done by her, and in the end she somehow managed to talk them out of pressing charges.",
  "Officer Rebecks didn't remember what she'd said, but he did recall that she'd never returned for the book. It was sitting in evidence for almost a year before, as far as Rebecks was aware, it simply vanished.",
  "I, I don't really know what to make of any of this. I'm, uh, I'm confused, I'm, I'm dizzy, I, I think I saw the police officer from Chicago again, in the station where I was talking to Rebecks.",
  "I'm not... feeling well...",
  "Elias has, um...",
  "I, I, got a letter, well, an envelope... it's, it's a statement. There's, there's a note, \"to tide you over,\" and, uh...",
  "Statement of Howard Ewing, regarding his interview with an unidentified member of British Transport Police. Original statement given February 1st, 2010. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "He just sits there. He's wearing the uniform of the British Transport Police. Three pips on his shoulder, but he won't show me his badge, he won't show me any ID.",
  "Why are they doing this? I didn't do anything. The officers that brought me here were friendly, kind. It was only after they left and it got so hot and he started sitting across from me.",
  "He's smiling, asking me questions again and again.",
  "\"What were you doing earlier tonight?\"",
  "He laughs, and I wince as sweat drops into my eye.",
  "\"When did you first notice something was wrong?\"",
  "We had just started work on the platform itself when we heard the tannoy come on. I don't know how. As far as I kne, it wasn't even powered. But there was that slight crackle and then: \"this is a security announcement\"",
  "Then it stopped completely, and we all looked at each other again, catching our breath, trying to figure out who to report this to, and how.",
  "\"How did you become aware of the train?\"",
  "The others looked like they had mostly recovered from the screeching tannoy, and were noticing my odd movements and came over to investigate themselves.",
  "I saw Vihan pull a face as he approached, and I pointed weakly to the opening of the tunnel. I carefully climbed down onto the tracks and looked out into the dark that led to Old Street. That's when I saw it.",
  "\"What did the carriage look like?\"",
  "\"What did it look like?\"",
  "\"What did it look like?\"",
  "It looked like hell.",
  "\"What did you hear?\"",
  "From behind me I heard the shouts of Kelly and Rehan, though I don't know if it was because they saw it, too, or because they saw me fall to my knees in horror.",
  "I could hear the tannoy again, now clearly speaking: \"Will Inspector Sands please report, will Inspector Sands please report,\" over and over again.",
  "He smiles, and the tiny room gets hotter.",
  "\"Who is Inspector Sands?\"",
  "It's a code, one of the codes we use to alert staff to situations of disaster or fire. It usually means there's a fire. It's to keep people calm. It's meant to not cause any panic, keep them safe, even if there's an emergency.",
  "He laughs, and I wish I could go home.",
  "\"How many people were on the train?\"",
  "I don't know.",
  "\"What sort of train carriage was it?\"",
  "I don't know.",
  "\"Where did it come from?\"",
  "I don't know.",
  "\"Did you scream?\"",
  "At least I think so. The back of my throat was dry and hot and painful, so my mouth must have been open. I think I was screaming.",
  "\"What were your colleagues doing?\"",
  "Vihan was gripping me by the shoulders, shaking me, yelling at me to wake up. But I was awake, I was wide awake, and I think in some ways he was talking to himself. Kelly was walking past me, trying to battle through the choking rancid smoke.",
  "I hope she was planning to try and rescue those trapped in the wreckage, but maybe she was simply trying to join them.",
  "I couldn't do anything to help either of them, and I knew that if I touched them I would burn them.",
  "He inhales as if in triumph.",
  "\"And where are they now?\"",
  "At least that's what I was told when the officers brought me here.",
  "They found no wreckage, nothing in the tunnels, no corpses wailing through an underground inferno, just the dead and burnt bodies of Kelly Dwyer and Vihan Prasad.",
  "\"What do you love most in the world?\"",
  "\"What do you love most in the world?\"",
  "My father. I love my father more than anything.",
  "\"Who am I?\"",
  "I don't answer, and he lets me leave.",
  "My father is dead a week later.",
  "I know he'll be back, the policeman with three bright pips on his shoulder.",
  "And he'll ask me what else I love. And I'll tell him.",
  "Then he'll ask me who he is, and I won't say.",
  "I don't want to cause any panic.",
  "Statement ends.",
  "I'm going to bed.",
  "I feel... a lot better.",
  "What irritates me most is that Elias was clearly aware of this, hence his sending me this, which seems to serve no other purpose but as a restorative. But, *as usual,* he chose to keep this very useful information to himself.",
  "I think I've reached another dead end here. I've decided it's the last one. The Institute needs me there, not jetting around the world following a cold trail that may well not have led to anything useful the first time.",
  "I've a Greyhound booked down to Washington DC tomorrow. I'm going to stop in at the Usher Foundation, just in case they have anything that might help, and then I'm flying home.",
  "And she is... definitely watching me. She doesn't *look* like -- she's coming over, I think --",
  "Hello? Uhh, can I... help you?",
  "You, you're English.",
  "Who are you?",
  "Uh... uh, you don't know me?",
  "No, I-I guess! Just, uh, I mean everyone normally seems to.",
  "Oh, uh, uh, Jonathan! -- uh, John. Sims. Uh, I'm the Head Archivist for the Magnus Institute. London.",
  "Uh, look, I mean... you're the one following *me.*",
  "...uh... my, my bus is leaving...",
  "I don't think so.",
  "So... kidnapped. *Again.*",
  "Do I have any choice?",
  "...are you alright? You seem, uh...",
  "Uh, yes. You, you know the Institute...?",
  "Oh, uh, that would be Gertrude. My, my predecessor.",
  "Uh, I'm starting to.",
  "Uh ... would you... believe me if I said I was trying to save the world?",
  "What about you?",
  "What brings the daughter of Robert Montauk all the way out here? And why, exactly are you --",
  "J-J-Julia, I-I don't, I don't think -- ah...",
  "Uh -- T-Trevor Herbert, the, the Vampire Killer!",
  "What, the, the, the police officer? I think I have an idea.",
  "I-I-I, I don't..."

  "You're heading to DC, right? Come on, we can chat in the car. I'm sure you've got a *ton* of librarian stories. The miles will just *fly* by.",
  "If you did you'd only make a mistake.",
  "Sure. Just keeping an eye out. Waiting, you know.",
  "So you're from the Magnus Institute?",
  "Oh, yeah. Checked myself in there a while back. Ended up spilling my guts to this old woman about my dad. Just, letting it all out.",
  "Didn't catch her name.",
  "Weirdest thing, really. Didn't mean to spill half of it, but... really helped me put the pieces together. You know?",
