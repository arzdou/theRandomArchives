  "You too, Basira, if you're hearing this.  I know you'd -- stop me. You'd be right to, but -- but if this goes wrong, all you lose is --  I'm not risking anyone else. And I know --  I-I think. I can get her out.",
  "Right. You're coming with me.",
  "Let's do this one properly.",
  "No need for that. I'm willing.",

  "I'm not sure how long it's been. The steps ended, eventually. There's passages, but -- it's very, uh... It's close. I'm having some trouble, but. I'm going the right way. I know it. I just -- I-I just need to keep moving. When I stop, it --",
  "It starts to -- p-press on me.",
  "Just keep going.",

  "My torch is broken. I didn't even drop it. It -- It got caught against the wall, and --",
  "Crushed. God, I --  I don't even know how long I've been here.",
  "I still have Daisy's tape. And I still think I'm going the right way. When I move at all.",
  "Feels like every inch costs me another scrape, o-or bruise.  I'd hoped I was beyond that, but apparently not. And --",
  "I-I think --  Oh god. I-I-I think I'm -- I'm stuck.",
  "Oh no. N--",
  "Daisy! Daisy, can you reach me?",
  "Follow my voice.",
  "Yes.  I'm here, Daisy.",
  "Are you alright?",
  "Are you... Are you okay?",
  "Sorry. Obviously. No, I just meant -- Y-You sound -- okay.",
  "I thought you might've been -- taken over. By the Hunt.",
  "The Hunt. You're a Hunter.",
  "The coffin. We're in the coffin. I-It leads to... Well, it's got a lot of names. Choke. The Buried.  Too-Close-I-Cannot-Breathe.",

  "It's okay, I've uh -- I've got a plan.",
  "It's fine; I just -- I just need to -- to find it.",
  "Come on. Come on, where are you?",
  "No. No, not alone.",

  "Okay, um. What do you want to talk about?",
  "Well, I'm not going anywhere.",

  "Right.  Uh...",
  "How are you feeling?",
  "One thing I've learned, Daisy, is that we all get a choice. Even if it doesn't feel like one.",
  "I mean, I definitely got that impression when you  dragged me into the woods for an execution.",
  "I... I did not know that.",

  "Yeah -- I guess I was. But -- not here.",

  "Y-Yeah, yes, alright. Do your... thing.",

  "It knows when to stop. W-When to e-ease back, so you don't -- don't lose it, or grow numb. L-Leaves you terrified for when it s-starts again, and when it does, y-you're, you're s-scared it'll --  never -- never stop.",
  "I thought -- thought I'd  I'd ne-never see the sky again, never --  never s-see Basira --",

  "Did you ever hear the story Elias told me? About what I -- did. How I am. He -- He didn't get a detail wrong. The Hunt. Hunger was in me all my life. Telling me who to chase. How to hurt them.  I never needed to think. Who I was outside of that.",
  "Y-You know what I thought, when I woke up here? I thought this was *hell*. I wa-- I was dead, and I was in hell. And I --  I knew I deserved it.",
  "I don't want t-to b-be a s-sadistic predator again. I-I don't want to hobble around like some -- *pathetic* wounded prey either. I don't know which would be worse. But I'm sc-scared now. That I won't ever get the choice.",
  "I was gonna kill you. You know that, right?",
  "No.  No. After the mission. I was planning to kill you.",
  "I realized -- you were in my dreams. R-R-Reliving -- this. T-The coffin. You were *there*.",
  "Didn't think it was real. Not really. Just my mind putting you there, because I *hated* you, but no. One night, you turn up in a new shirt. Didn't fit you. Not your style.",
  "I-I didn't think much of it, just a-a dream. Then you come back from the States, and guess what you're wearing.",
  "Realized what was happening then. Realized you weren't human. Needed to die, as soon as it was safe. Never mind Elias, and his... *insurance*.",
  "Don't know. I-I miss dreaming. You don't sleep, down here.",
  "Yeah. Well. At the moment, I don't care.",
  "But we can't get out.",
