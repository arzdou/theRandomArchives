  "So this is -- ten years of cobwebs?",
  "So -- where are all the spiders?",
  "John, focus. Are you getting any sense of anything? Can you... See anything?",
  "These flares going to work?",
  "I mean, at least until we find the one Gertrude stocked up.",
  "Right next to the nukes.",
  "So what if it is?",
  "I mean, anything we do could be part of the \"grand master plan.\" So, what -- we do nothing? Just sit on our hands and hope that's not what the Spider wants?",
  "You want to come back later?",
  "You wanna -- take a moment before we head up?",
  "No, I don't hear --",
  "Don't touch it.",
  "Is -- that what I think it is?",
  "Well, that's it, then.",
  "Come on, let's finish up and get out of here.",

 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "Doesn't look like anyone ever moved in, though.",
  "Was that a *joke?*",
  "No, I'm just seeing what you're seeing. Still a bit weak from my trip up north, to be honest.",
  "I'm sure the flares will work fine.  I mean, un, unless it's all an elaborate plan to have us burn this place down again.",
  "I don't follow.",
  "Well, we're here now. Might as well push on.",
  "What about the basement?",
  "Uh -- no. No, I've, I've got it.",
  "You hear that?",
  "*-- organisation dedicated to academic research into the esoteric and the paranormal. The head of the Institute, Mr. Elias Bouchard, has employed me to replace the previous Head Archivist, one Gertrude Robinson, who has recently passed away.*",
  "I see it. Uh -- Hand me that brush?",
  "Official Institute paper and everything.",
  "Statement of Annabelle Cane. She left it for us.",
  "I -- I mean -- Are we burning it?",
  "Statement of --  -- *Annabelle Cane*. Regarding her history and her observations of the Magnus Institute, London. Original statement written 20th July, 2018. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.",
  "Free will is a funny old thing, isn't it John? Can I call you John? I'm going to call you John.",
  "Such a strange concept, woven from a thousand different ignorances and experiences, a faculty we only ever truly ascribe to ourselves, and -- I suppose, to our gods.",
  "We talk about workings of its mind, and instincts; if it doesn't chase the ball, we wonder why: Is it sick, is it tired? Perhaps something in the nature of this particular breed, this particular dog, makes it prone to ignoring a game of fetch.",
  "The idea of a dog simply *choosing* not to chase feels deeply unnatural. Is it even capable of legitimately making a decision; some would say no.",
  "Of course, people are very different from dogs. Our brains are larger. More complex. So many more little factors and wrinkles to push us and pull us -- but does any of that actually constitute free will?",
  "Scans show decisions are made by your brain long before your conscious mind even has a chance to register them. Most of one's life is simply spent looking back and convincing yourself that you chose deliberately to act like you did.",
  "Hm. Have you ever read *War and Peace,* John? I know, I know; I had to read an extract for a literature class once, ended up reading the whole thing.",
  "It's not actually as boring as people say, and its central thesis is that the tiniest, most insignificant factors can control the destiny of the world.",
  "But, he argues, it is quite impossible for the human mind to comprehend even a fraction of these. And in that vast, dark space of ignorance lies: free will.",
  "Isn't that marvelous, John? Free will is simply ignorance. It's just the name we give to the fact that no one can ever really see everything that controls them.",
  "Of course, that's not the real crux of the free will question that's bothering you at the moment, is it? I think that one probably comes down to whether or not you're *choosing* to continue reading this statement out loud.",
  "You didn't mean to, did you? No, I'm sure you told Basira and Melanie that you were going to glance over it and report back; perhaps they asked you if you were going to record, and you shook your head: maybe later.",
  "That sounds like the sort of thing you'd say.",
  "I know the summaries have started to confuse you; where did they come from, when you read a statement fresh? How do you just -- know what it's about, before you even start to read it?",
  "But by then you're away; the roller coaster is dropping, and you've no real choice but to hold on and hope that -- *I don't crash you*.",
  "I'm afraid I don't actually have these answers for you; *I've* simply been... watching. I'm sure you understand that.",
  "*Maybe* I've occasionally been nudging something here and there to keep you safe, to keep everything on track. But I know you've been more worried about your choices, about whether you're being controlled by me, or by the Mother.",
  "So I thought perhaps I should leave a little something to reassure you that, yes, your actions and choices have all been your own.",
  "Have they been controlled? No more than gravity controls you when you walk, or hunger controls you when you choose your meal. There are certainly new forces, new instincts and desires, that shape your actions; perhaps you're unprepared for them.",
  "But if you choose to believe in a free will, then yes: All you have done has been of your own free will. They have all been your choices.",
  "Now, I believe the tradition is to tell you the story of my life, the sinister path that led me to the sorry state in which I now find myself.",
  "Well, let it never be said that I do not dance the steps I am assigned.",
  "I was one of the youngest, and it soon became clear to my infant mind that in order to get anywhere, the key was to navigate the baroque family politics in which I found myself.",
  "In many ways, she was the victim, at least of my father, whose pathological absence spoke of a man who had no interest whatsoever in engaging with the life where he had trapped his family.",
  "However well I had learned my lessons, it was clear that happiness was not something I could have; within that family there was simply too much that I couldn't control.",
  "We lived in Hunstanton, in Norfolk, about twenty minutes walk from the beach, and it was late spring, so I wasn't at all worried about the temperature.",
  "If you walked down the short hill from Hunstanton Town Centre and towards the beach, and took a right just before you reached it, you could find yourself on a small stretch of sand that seemed oddly quiet.",
  "CHIPS, it said.",
  "I don't really know why I decided to hide there, but assuming you've been paying attention, I'm sure you understand by now how little that means. Perhaps deep down, I simply knew it would be unlocked.",
  "Against the vivid red-orange of the sky, the old chip shop seemed almost black, like a fallen obelisk. A light rain began to patter down, and I, not having had the foresight to pack an umbrella, ran to it.",
  "I awoke to the sound of rhythmic clattering, the noise of wood striking wood in a complex, intricate pattern. I got up, more curious than fearful at that moment, and took few, tentative steps towards it.",
  "The sound seemed to be coming from one of the back rooms, and seeing as how light seeped from only one of the doors, it seemed to me pretty obvious which room contained my answer.",
  "So I went inside. Another action which, looking back after the fact, I found myself pleasingly baffled by.",
  "Looking back, of course, and remembering the crunch of used syringes beneath my feet, I realize that addiction is one of the strongest vectors of control there is.",
  "Her eyes met mine, and traveled upwards towards the ceiling. I followed her gaze for barely five seconds before I fled home, and abandoned my plans to run away entirely.",
  "I may have decided not to describe what I saw up there. I will only say that it is what engendered in me that terror of spiders which eventually led to my volunteering at Surrey University!",
  "I will simply say that -- when a spider reaches a certain size, it is often not entirely made up of *spider* anymore.",
  "So how much free will was involved in that story? What could I have chosen to change? Would a different path have been possible?",
  "Unless, of course, none of it was intentional. None of it was planned. The Mother is the fear of manipulation and lost control made manifest. So perhaps it is our fear that projects her influence on everything that happens.",
  "Like the mind: retrospectively assigning reason to our actions, so we fit whatever occurs into the neatest pattern we can, and declare her web both intricate and complete.",
  "Perhaps she is no more active than Terminus, simply sitting and reveling in the inevitable cascade of paranoia, as those who hold her in special terror cocoon themselves in red string and theory.",
  "Or perhaps I am simply telling you what you need to hear in order to ensure you behave exactly as the Mother wishes you to.",
  "Perhaps I have never even seen a beach.",
  "*Don't* go to Hill Top Road again.",
  "That was, uh... I didn't -- I, I, I didn't like that. I couldn't --",
  "So. She is watching the Institute. Interfering with things.  Is that reassuring, or merely really bad?",
  "I can't say I'm... I can't say I'm sad to have another ally allegedly on our side, but I don't like the idea of being important to the Web.",
  "That's a really bad place to be.",
  "Annabelle's right, though. I mean, I can't trust anything she says to not be another lie to further manipulate and maneuver us, but deep down I think she's right.",
  "What I've been doing to these people, it -- it hasn't been because I was puppeted, or controlled, or possessed.",
  "I wanted to do it. It felt good.",
  "But at least I know I *can* stop; I just -- don't know how. I --  I don't -- *want* to stop.  Goddamn, this one really took it out of me. I need to go lie down.  End recording."

  "Sorry we couldn't stop for a *snack*.",
  "What even are these?",
  "Oh. Fine. Uh -- and, and -- please don't call me Mel.",
  "Always. I'm --  -- trying to be more open about this stuff.",
  "Right, sure, but it *wouldn't* hurt to have a *bit* more of a plan, would it?",
  "*Yes!* That's what I said, isn't it?",
