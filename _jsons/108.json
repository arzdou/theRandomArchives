 "MARTIN": [
  "Martin Blackwood, archival assistant at the Magnus Institute recording statement number 0092008. Statement of Adonis Biros, given August 20th, 2009.",
  "Have you ever had stage lights in your eyes? The brightness steals everything else, and if it's strong enough, you can look out into the audience and see nothing at all. Just you.",
  "I am a fine actor, and a very capable physical performer, but these are simply the dues I pay to earn my way to a monologue. For the last two weeks, I have been performing the part of Jaques in As You Like It. Do you know your Shakespeare?",
  "> \"All the world's a stage,",
  "> And all the men and women on it merely players:",
  "> They have their exits and their entrances;",
  "> And one man in his time plays many parts,",
  "> His acts being seven ages.\"",
  "It helps that we're performing at the Duke's Theatre in Covent Garden: it's about as traditional a theatre as you're likely to find, and when the light shines, the audience is rendered as mere silhouettes, completely anonymous.",
  "At least, until four nights ago.",
  "But I knew it was empty. It was a hollow shape of a man that had no life, no presence to it. And I saw it in the middle of the third row as clearly as if it were lit by a second spotlight.",
  "The mask and cloak did not appear at the theater the following night. I looked for it, yet saw nothing but an audience of silhouettes, quiet and intent, save for when applause was required.",
  "The figure didn't move. Of course it didn't, there was nothing to it that could move -- no will that could make it follow me. And yet, it still watched, its hollow empty eyes drawing me into it.",
  "Once I looked up, and the windows were full of it.",
  "I don't know how long I ran, but in the end I fell, physically spent, and sunken in despair. Raising my head, I saw it before me, waiting. So I stood, and began to walk slowly towards it.",
  "I went home quickly, my eyes downcast and furtive, and went to bed. I only once looked out of my window at the street below.",
  "Perhaps I should have stopped: fled the stage, quit acting entirely. But it was like a lonely avalanche, and it flowed out of me in a wave. And I reached oblivion. An absence of applause that nearly deafened me. Sans everything.",
  "I tried to listen, to nod, but his eyes were hollow, and I knew that he wasn't really there.",
  "I have another performance tonight. In less than four hours, I will be on that stage again, speaking those empty lines to emptier ears.",
  "I could run, of course, but I won't. Where would I run to? All the world's a stage, and I can't escape my monologue.",
  "I wanted to ask Tim about it, but he hasn't been around much the last week or so. Says he's working on something, which is... I mean, it *could* be fine? I guess? He's just... quite... *intense* at the moment... He -- scares me sometimes.",
  "John called. He's in America now, wanted her to help with something, but I had to make an excuse for her. He, he doesn't need that kind of thing on his mind right now...",
  "I just hope he gets back soon.",
  "...You know, saying it out loud, I, I think I'm actually really worried about Melanie. I --  you know what, Basira knows her better than. I've  been too awkward to ask, but I *need* to. I really think I need to --",
  "Basira?",
  "D-don't move! And, don't you come any closer, okay?! I've got a, I've got a *knife!*",
  "Okay, but -- okay, *stay back!*",
  "Oh. You're... one of them, aren't you? A, a Lukas.",
  "I, I was just, reading? John left some notes, and --",
  "I don't -- what?!",
  "Yeah? Sort of -- I mean, you know, not you *specifically,* but --",
  "I'm really sorry -- I-I don't actually -- ahaha --",
  "That's... that's a lot of it, to be honest.",
  "Well, he's... I mean, you just... you've just said he's watching us.",
  "Fine, I guess? I mean, not so much with the manipulation, and... sometimes... the murder?",
  "I mean I wasn't, I wasn't *there,* but that's what he said? And I did see the body. Bodies.",
  "Yeah! Um... did you see anyone?",
  "Out there, just now?",
  "That figures.",
  "Does the name Peter Lukas mean anything to you?",
  "Yeah, well, apparently that warning doesn't go *both* ways.",
  "Yeah. I, I mean, I think, I *think* so...?",
  "I mean, a bit, yeah.",
  "Mmmmaybe? I don't know, honestly, he was just a *bit*... weeeeird.",
  "Oh, no, like -- you busy?",
  "I don't know.",
  "What -- Halley like the comet?",
  "Look, Basira, that's *really* interesting but that's not why -- uh, uh, you're close to Melanie, right?",
  "Is she, she doing okay?",
  "No... no, it's just her work's been... look, she's always been quite, you know, conscientious, but then recently, everything's --",
  "Elias. Oh, god...",
  "Well, well, maybe we can -- what?"

 "PETER": [
  "Martin, isn't it?",
  "Do you? That would seem wildly out-of-character, from what I've been told.",
  "Please, Martin, I'm not going to hurt you. I just thought we might have a chat.",
  "Yes, that's -- Peter, pleased to meet you! Now, how did you know that?",
  "I see. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.",
  "It's one of Elias's little jokes.",
  "Did *he* suggest you record a statement today? One that mentioned me?",
  "I have a meeting with him today. He suggested it. I'm sure he's watching from his office, grinning from ear to ear.",
  "I almost thought he genuinely wanted me to meet the team. Ah, well.",
  "Do I scare you, Martin?",
  "Hmm. Probably for the best. And what's Elias like to work for? Aside from orchestrating unsettling encounters?",
  "And that's not something you look for in an employer, I assume?",
  "How is he as a boss?",
  "Oh! That *doesn't* sound like the Elias I know. He killed people *himself?*",
  "Elias Bouchard, getting his hands dirty... ah, well. *Must* be the end times.",
  "So, your advice would be *less* murder?",
  "No, no, it's a good observation, I thank you for it.",
  "Well, I'm sure I've disturbed you quite enough for one day. Martin, I have a meeting to get to and a few things to tell Elias to his face about wasting both our time. Be seeing you! As it were."

 "BASIRA": [
  "Did you call me?",
  "So, did you need anything, or...?",
  "Oh! *Yes,* actually. I've been reading a bunch of old statements, he's that creepy old boat captain, right? From the family Elias doesn't want us bothering.",
  "He was here?",
  "Was he... *woOoOo?*",
  "Oh. Oh, dear.",
  "Yeah. Is that why you wanted me?",
  "A bit. I was reading through a bunch of stuff about the Church of the Divine Host...?",
  "Did you look into that statement about the chapel in Hither Green? Because apparently, right around that time, there was a full solar eclipse going on in -- guess where...?",
  "Ny-\u00c5lesund! And when Natalie Ennis talked about it being 300 years ago -- well! How much do you know about the relationship between Edmond Halley and John Flamsteed?",
  "Um, I guess so? Closer than anyone here, I think.",
  "Why? Did she... say something?",
  "Okay, look. I don't know what the situation is, she *won't* tell me, but she's *not* doing well. We were meant to go for a drink last week, but... I *think* it has something to do Elias."
