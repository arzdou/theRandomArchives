  "Oh, not to worry! I seem to be doing all right so far.",
  "And quite right, too! Goodness, the things they could learn here! Turn your hair white, eh?  Best to keep them out, I say.",
  "Ah! You must be *Martin.* Goodness, he was not exaggerating.",
  "Oh, come now, don't be like that.",
  "Let's start over. Simon. Simon Fairchild. Peter asked me to look in on you and have a small chat. Well, a big chat, really. Answer all those... nagging questions."
 ],
 "MARTIN": [
  "Um, excuse me sir -- uh, sorry, you -- can't actually be here?",
  "No, I, I mean -- this area is actually off limits to the public, so --",
  "...who are you? Did *Peter* send you?",
  "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "... Wait, Simon Fairchild, as in --",
  "No, no!  Not, not at all. You, you've sent *plenty* of people our way.",
  "S-sorry,  I'm still not *entirely* clear what's going on. What *are* you doing here?",
  "I, I mean, sort of.",
  "So -- so, what, he sends you to answer questions because he doesn't want to?",
  "And you *do* it? *Why?*",
  "...is there a limit?",
  "O...okay, okay then, sure, sure. First question, then. Why are you helping Peter? Don't you serve different, you know, fears?",
  "And being aware of how lonely you are  can make anywhere feel more empty.",
  "How are new powers born?",
  "How soon could it attempt this ritual?",
  "How do we stop it?",
  "Could you at least *try?*",
  "And *how close is it,* do you think?",
  "You don't sound worried.",
  "Sounds like a rich feeding ground.",
  "And let me guess: you think he can't see *the big picture.*",
  "-- I -- I don't know, that space station...?",
  "So why didn't it work?",
  "I don't see your point.",
  "Assuming the Extinction doesn't derail everything...!",
  "It doesn't *scare* you...?",
  "I think our experience of the universe has value. Even if it disappears forever.",
  "So what do you *do,* then, if -- if the world is pointless, and your god is so weak right now?",
  "I thought *you* said that the maths doesn't work.",
  "You make it sound like the -- the entities don't even know what they're doing.",
  "You can't be *serious!*",
  "Yes, yes, I think I get it.",
  "...What about the monsters?",
  "Things like Mi-- erm, uh, the Distortion. I thought they were part of the entities themselves -- like, extensions. Surely *they* know what's going on.",
  "So -- so, if no one's ever actually communicated with their patron, how do you know they even want rituals? How -- h-how does anyone know if they could ever even work?",
  "Who are you? No, no -- who *were* you?",
  "And -- and how did you get started with it all? Did you -- did -- did you just look up at the sky one day and fall head-over-heels in love?",
  "Er -- I'm sorry?",
  "It does seem like it.",
  "Sit back down.",
  "You said you were here to answer my questions for Peter, but so far you've told me basically *nothing* of any use.",
  "Then let's try some smaller ones.",
  "Is Peter attempting a ritual?",
  "How honest has he been with me?",
  "Protecting the others.",
  "But -- but that was never the endgame, was it? He just wanted me on his side long enough to rope me into his, his plans for the Extinction.",
  "Fine. So, why *me?* What's his plan? Why not get the others involved?",
  "And he needs me to use it...?",
  "They need to serve the Lonely.",
  "How do *you* feel about this?",
  "All of it. Peter's plan, the Extinction, me...?",
  "You don't think it'll be the end of the world?",
  "No, it's...  Thank you. This has... actually been quite helpful.",
  "Basira, please, I *don't* have time --",
  "Basira, *let go.*",
  "How did you know about --",
  "It's none of your business.",
  "You know about that?",
  "Shh, shh!",
  "Well, there you go, then!",
  "I didn't know John had listened to them already.",
  "Look, I don't have time for this. I don't *like* that I have to work with Peter any more than you do, and I didn't *know* that Simon was involved until today.",
  "But I would *hope* that you and John understood the importance of preventing an apocalypse.",
  "Yeah, well, that's *your* problem.",
  "*I can't.* Peter's the one with the plan, and... it needs me to be alone.",
  "Of *course* I do, but it -- might be the only way, and... so far at least he's been honest with me. Awful, but... honest.",
  "I need to do this.",
  "I'll do what I have to. If I'm right, no one else needs to get hurt.",
  "I know what I'm doing.",
  "Don't... tell John.",
  "How is he?",
  "That's good.",
  "Can I go now?"
 ],
 "SIMON": [
  "As in, all those people who said I did horrible things to them and their loved ones? Yes!",
  "...They *have* been in, haven't they? I'd hate to think I'm underrepresented in here -- not when Peter tells me that that  *bone* fellow has at least half a dozen --",
  "Brilliant! So. Shall we get started?",
  "I see! I suppose it was a bit much to expect him to have filled you in on everything already. I mean -- in many ways -- that's the point.",
  "So. You've been working with Peter for a while now, correct?",
  "And he's been promising you answers to all those -- difficult questions?",
  "Well, that's me.",
  "Something to do with his upbringing, I think.  I'm pretty sure he was home-schooled, you know!",
  "Is that your first question?",
  "Only until I get bored. And that does tend to come more quickly these days.",
  "Well, now... See, that's actually *two* questions. The answer to the first is simple. I lost a bet, and this is how the good Captain chooses to use that.",
  "The second is... sort of? I mean -- yes, if you want to get technical, he serves the One Alone and I serve the Falling Titan, but those two are a lot closer than you might imagine.",
  "After all, the larger the space you find yourself alone in, the more isolated you feel.",
  "Also, I worry it might be straying into territory that emboldens our potential new rival.",
  "The very same. Peter said you'd have a lot of questions about that one.",
  "Hmm... Don't know.",
  "No clue.",
  "Can't help you.",
  "No, no, no, you're right, of course. The thing you have to remember is that no one actually knows how these things work -- not *really.*",
  "There's always been plenty of theories, of course, and over a century or two you do start to get an intuitive feel for it, but... there's really no hard-and-fast *rules.*",
  "The powers, or entities, or fears, or whatever you want to call them, are bound up in emotion. In feeling. How they exist, what they can do, how they interact with the world... it all makes about as much logical sense as a nightmare.",
  "Which is to say, there is a certain sort of emotional logic to it all: things *feel* like they flow together in a way that makes sense, but if you try to stop and do the maths, then it all comes apart. At least, in my experience.",
  "*When* is a new power born? Well, when does it *feel* like its birth would be right? When enough creatures suffer a terror of it that *feels* distinct, that *feels* truly its own? Then it would probably feel right for it to emerge into its own.",
  "Or perhaps there's a ritual. If it *feels* right to enact some sort of birthing ceremony, some... apocalyptic midwifery --",
  "Hard to be sure. Peter thinks very close indeed, what with all the current hubbub, and I'm inclined to agree.",
  "Well, exactly! Peter, however, seems to think that it will upset the balance that we all have an awful lot invested in. And he's not at all certain the world as we understand will come out the other side.",
  "I see why he likes you.",
  "Do you know when the last ritual I attempted was?",
  "[^1]: Edmond Halley again?",
  "Because it wasn't a very good idea...? The fear wasn't out there -- not like I hoped it was. It all sort of... fizzled.",
  "Also, a Hunter broke in and destroyed the mechanism. Sent me and all my sacrifices plummeting to the bottom of the ocean.",
  "My point is...",
  "...you know, I've quite forgotten!",
  "Hey, I've just not been doing much recently. It's not a good time for perspective, you see. The world all feels too small these days.",
  "I used to do a lot with religion, but it's just not got the same conceptual scope as it used to. Honestly, I'm pinning most of my long-term hopes on space. But that's at least a hundred years away.",
  "Which is why I'm happy helping Peter.",
  "But, if it does, then I'll either be dead, which will be fine, or... I'll adjust.",
  "What a lonely way to look at things. Which makes sense, I suppose.",
  "*I* have a good time. And do my best to avoid the drama.",
  "It's all been getting a bit much over the last few decades. I blame the number of people. From a raw numbers point of view, it's getting very busy. More minds equals more fear, after all.",
  "Oh, you *are* a quick one!",
  "So, maybe I'm wrong! But, crucially, I suspect a lot of the other servants and creatures out there have a similar idea. Probably why they're all in such a rush to make their own attempts.",
  "I have no idea if they're \"doing\" anything at all. If they're even capable of \"doing\" things. I know that most of their servants are simply doing their best to interpret and serve something that is almost definitively inconceivable.",
  "Yes, well the point is: most of us are trying so desperately to recreate our own dream symphony that we bring an awful lot of our own baggage into the mix.",
  "And honestly? The idea that this is all some grand cosmic joke -- thousands of us running around spreading horror and sabotaging each other pointlessly, while these impossible, unknowable things just lurk out there, feeding off the misery we cause?",
  "I find that interpretation *quite appealing.*",
  "But, I still hear the music in my dreams.",
  "Originally? No one you would have heard of. No great historical figure or atrocity-monger.",
  "Sort of, actually.",
  "I should, of course, have fallen to the floor of the church, broken my neck. But that blue-painted sky welcomed me with open arms. And I never looked back.",
  "No wonder I'm so sympathetic to the Lonely!",
  "You know, this really is a place for self-discovery, isn't it?  Statement ends, I suppose.",
  "Oh, nothing, just my own hubris.",
  "Well, this *has* been fun. Now, if we're about done --",
  "I like it.",
  "The big answers are rarely helpful.",
  "Not in the sense that you're used to. Him and his family made their play a few years ago, and they failed. I'm sure he'd like me to explain it, but I think he can do that one himself.",
  "About which part?",
  "I think he tried. I suspect he may have slightly exaggerated his abilities when you first made the deal, but he certainly expended a reasonable amount of influence and resources to follow through.",
  "Do you really need me to answer that one?",
  "He is what he is, Martin. For a creature of the Lonely, the urge is always to isolate, never to communicate or connect.",
  "I suspect that's why he's so keen on wagers. It allows him a framework for cooperation that doesn't risk any sort of intimacy.",
  "As for his plan... I don't know the details! But I believe there is something in the Institute that he thinks can help his cause.",
  "Presumably. From what he said, it must be powerfully aligned to the Watcher. If he wishes to use it, it would need someone already touched by the Eye. And if he wants to *control* that someone --",
  "You might need to be a *tad* more specific.",
  "I think... I think Peter is taking a rather large but calculated gamble. Not just on you, but on a lot of things. If it works, he'll be in a very strong position. And if he fails, it won't be all that bad.",
  "Sorry. *Too* big-picture? I get that a lot.",
  "I'd say, \"any time,\" but honestly, if you see me again... I may just throw you off something for a joke.",
  "How do you feel about -- roller coasters?",
  "Oh. You're no fun."

 "BASIRA": [
  "Who was that?",
  "Oh, no, you don't.",
  "I don't think so. Three weeks I've been waiting to catch sight of you, and now I find you chatting with Simon Fairchild. No, you're not pulling your little vanishing act on me.",
  "Yeah, John's not the only one who listens to statements.",
  "No? Because it seems to me like you're palling around with two very dangerous people, right around the time you're cutting all of us out.",
  "That makes me worried. It makes me *suspicious.*",
  "Tell me I'm wrong.",
  "So what's going on, then?",
  "*Talk to me.*",
  "What, they're just here out of the goodness of their hearts? Helping you save the world from Extinction?",
  "Yeah, John found the tapes you made for him --",
  "Found a stash of them a while ago. I made sure he shared with the club --",
  "John may be going through a whole \"we have to trust Martin\" thing, but I'm not. As far as I can see, you're either compromised, or you're being played. And I want to know which.",
  "Well, he has. *He* seems to think you'll come to him when you need him. *I* think you're feeding him what he needs to hear, so he doesn't bother you.",
  "...I guess I'm just a bit burned out on the end of the world.",
  "And if you really think this whole Extinction thing is it -- why not come to us for help?",
  "And you don't see anything suspicious about that --",
  "You're not expecting to come out of this, are you?",
  "You want to do whatever grand sacrifice you think is going to save everyone, go ahead. But you'd best be sure you're not just playing their game.",
  "Don't make me regret this.",
  "Fine. I can't promise you he won't just Know it, though.",
  "But... he's keeping it together."
