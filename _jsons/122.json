  "Do you have a tape re-- Oh.",
  "Thank you, Basira.",
  "Statement of uh,  Uh, Lorell St. John regarding, uh.",
  "Original statement given 1st February, 2015.",
  "Recording by  Jonathan Sims.",
  "People always used to tell me I was.",
  "They said that I -- never really *engaged* with other people, never acted like they really existed, or mattered, at least not in the same way that I did.",
  "I suppose in, in many ways they were right.",
  "It's hard to explain without sounding stupid.",
  "Obviously other people are real --  O-obviously, the, the way a building is real, or my watch is real.",
  "If people weren't real, I'm sure I'd find them much less of a chore.",
  "So no, I don't not believe in other people.",
  "I just find it very difficult to *feel* for others, I, I can't understand them, and they've always seemed.",
  "oh there's no tactful way to say it -- they've always seemed.",
  "I know what my pain feels like, and I know what my joy feels like, but when I see those same things on the faces of my friends, or my enemies, I feel.",
  "Well that's it, isn't it?",
  "I don't really feel anything.",
  "Their emotions and suffering feel as distant to me as a character on a movie screen.",
  "More distant, really.",
  "I-In many ways I find those crude characters that wander through ridiculous plot after ridiculous plot more relatable than the people watching next to me.",
  "That said, Danielle did tell me once that films tended to depict characters like that so it's easier to project yourself onto them.",
  "So maybe it isn't quite as surprising as all that.",
  "I like animals, too.",
  "They don't pretend to be important.",
  "So, assuming you can understand anything, I would hope that you could understand why the philosophical concept of zombies might worm its way into my mind.",
  "Danielle studies philosophy.",
  "W-Well, she *studied* philosophy.",
  "She said it really helped, and, well -- sometimes I didn't have anything better to do.",
  "It never stuck, of course; it's all kind of rubbish, really -- people trying to *think* the universe into making sense, coming up with all sorts of *nonsense* and trying to claim that 'if you can imagine it it must be true.",
  "' I'm, I'm grossly oversimplifying, of course, but I don't care.",
  "I don't think Danielle did very well in her exams.",
  "I remember the night she told me about zombies.",
  "It was dark outside and must have been late.",
  "It was high summer, and the days were long.",
  "Our building really kept the heat, and had very few opening windows, so even in the evening that humid warmth seemed to stick around.",
  "One of our housemates, Liam, was sat at the other end of the living room, playing some obnoxious video game.",
  "He had the lights at that end of the room turned off, and the screen lit up his blank, gormless face as he stared at some space monster or other that he had to kill.",
  "Danielle explained that a philosophical zombie is someone who outwardly displays all the signs of life and consciousness: they talk; they laugh; they scream; they even appear to think.",
  "But they have no inner life at all, no actual subjective experience.",
  "It's all a, a rule, a, a conjuring trick.",
  "If you cut them, they'd bleed, they might even cry out, but they wouldn't actually feel any pain, because they can't actually *feel* anything.",
  "It's all just an act.",
  "But, like I said, I don't think she got a very good grade, and looking at Liam, blankly staring into that glowing square on the wall, I, I knew she was wrong.",
  "They were real.",
  "His eyes were so dark, and -- dull.",
  "Empty windows to a soul that -- he didn't really have.",
  "I started to do some.",
  "experiments on him.",
  "N-not many, just a few little ones here and there to.",
  "I suppose you might've called them cruel, if Liam was capable of suffering; he certainly pretended to cry out in pain when I *accidentally* cut his hand while chopping onions, and he did a good impression of grief when his fish died.",
  "But his eyes were always the same: cold.",
  "I didn't *do* anything about it, obviously; what was the point?",
  "There was no real harm in him going out into the world *pretending* to live his life; it was no skin off my nose, certainly.",
  "It wasn't just him, though.",
  "so many more of them out there.",
  "At one point I did legitimately entertain the notion that they might *all* be zombies.",
  "That it was just me.",
  "That I was the only real person that existed.",
  "But, no, that wasn't right; it was just certain people; I watched their reactions, the emotions they didn't quite get right, and I *knew* they were a facade.",
  "It became like a game to me.",
  "Watching out for those.",
  "Whether on the bus, the street, or even meeting a client for work, I would look into their eyes for just a second, and see the emptiness inside.",
  "I tried to make it a game, at least.",
  "The truth was, they scared me very deeply.",
  "What were they?",
  "How did it happen; were they -- born hollow, or did something scoop them out, leave them like that?",
  "And the question that kept me up, staring into the darkness late at night -- why did it seem like I was the only one able to see them?",
  "I saw so many people, *real* people, chatting with these *zombies*, talking to them as if they were able to understand what was being said to them, rather than simply pretending.",
  "How was it that they couldn't see the quiet void that lurked behind each of their smiles.",
  "And there seemed to be more and more of them every day.",
  "Sometimes I found myself utterly alone.",
  "Facing down a room full of nothing eyes, willing myself to take action.",
  "I never did, though.",
  "Not even when one of them started following me.",
  "I first saw him in the street; it wasn't difficult to guess what he was; half the people around him were just as hollow and soulless.",
  "But there was something else, to him.",
  "He was tall.",
  "But not so tall as to stick out.",
  "Thin, but not unhealthily so.",
  "He wore a blue t-shirt despite the falling temperature, and his short, dark hair and pale skin surrounded a smile so fake, it practically glowed.",
  "He stared at me as I walked past, not making a move to follow or stop me; nor did his eyes seem to actually.",
  "It was like one of those paintings that watch you; it just seemed that whatever place I looked at him from, he just happened to be focused on me.",
  "In as much as there was any focus in them at all.",
  "The next day he was there again, this time in the hallway outside my office, standing in the center, so that I had to hug the wall to avoid touching his.",
  "He was identical.",
  "Except that his t-shirt was now a dull orange.",
  "I asked my colleague Norma what she thought of him, why he was there, and if she noticed anything strange about him.",
  "She looked out into the corridor, then, back at me and shook her head.",
  "She told me he seemed normal enough.",
  "But her eyes were like blank pits, and I knew she was lying about all of it.",
  "Had he done this?",
  "Had he taken Norma's.",
  "s-self, h-her soul, or.",
  "or had she *always been a zombie?",
  "* Cramped, into a little open-plan desk, patiently listening to client complaints, and I just hadn't *noticed*?",
  "I looked around my office, a low dread starting to build as he waited outside.",
  "A numbing cavity *wrapped in skin.",
  "I tried to talk to him, when he stood next to me on the bus.",
  "I played as casual as I could, trying not to seem afraid when I asked him how his day was going.",
  "\"Just fine, thank you for asking,\" came the flat, uninterested response.",
  "Then I, I asked him his name.",
  "\"Just fine, thank you for asking,\" he said.",
  "I have never wanted anything as much as I wanted in that moment to *cut* him, and see if he pretended to scream in pain.",
  "By the time he appeared outside my house, this time wearing a rotten green t-shirt, I could *feel* a numbness in myself even as I looked at him.",
  "Was I finally becoming like them?",
  "My internal world melting away into nothing but a *pantomime?",
  "* I remember I ran at him, all my rage burning inside my chest as though desperate to remind myself that I could still feel something.",
  "I think I might have been screaming, but the memory is fuzzy.",
  "I remember I punched him in the face, though.",
  "When my fist connected, it was like punching a canvas.",
  "Taught, dry, and -- yielding, ever so slightly, until all at once it broke with a tearing pop and all that resistance was gone, my fist falling into the empty space behind it.",
  "Inside his head, I-I pulled my hand back in sudden disgust, and he looked at me, through the torn and bloodless hole in his head.",
  "I could see one blank eye hanging down off his face, still following me, as his split mouth moved to try and form the words that I could hear clear as day: *\"Just fine, thank you for asking\".",
  "They're all like that now.",
  "*You're* all like that, I suppose.",
  "There is every chance that I am -- the only one left.",
  "And the whole world has fallen to a -- soulless horde, devoid of life and feeling.",
  "Even so, thank you for.",
  "pretending to care.",
  "Well that --  -- certainly helped, I think.",
  "No notes or -- followup in the statement, and.",
  "obviously no research done by myself or, uh.",
  "I think we can safely say that Ms. Saint-John is not the only person left in the world, though, whatever  she might be doing now.",
  "And whatever might be with her.",
  "They can be hard, though, other, other people.",
  "I-I'm -- I'm trying to focus, trying to make sure I'm the same me as before, but.",
  "how can anyone really remember that?",
  "How do you know you're the same person that went to sleep?",
  "Ah -- Uhh, yes -- I'm done.",
  "No, I, I wouldn't have, uh.",
  "Probably for the best.",
  "Yes, thank you.",
  "I --   Honestly?",
  "I don't know.",
  "I don't *feel*.",
  "I want to say I'm the same.",
  "But I don't -- really know if that's true.",
  "I *know* I'm different.",
  "more real, somehow.",
  "Probably nothing good.",
  "What happened to me?",
  "Everything was wrong.",
  "Gertrude was there, and then.",
  "dancing, I think.",
  "And I was somewhere else.",
  "sure, a-about Tim.",
  "And -- Daisy?",
  "Just you and me.",
  "And -- Melanie and M-Martin, I, I guess.",
  "Oh god -- the, the plan, it's -- Martin i-is -- is he okay, w-what --  *What did Elias do?",
  "So -- what?",
  "Wait, Martin's plan worked?",
  "Wow, uh -- o-okay, so -- what's the problem?",
  "I've read about him.",
  "*What did he do to Martin?",
  "No, that --  No, that -- that -- There must be something else.",
  "Well I guess we should probably let one of the nurses know I'm awake.",
  "I'm sure they've got all sorts of -- tests to do, make sure I'm not a -- zombie, or.",
  "I don't suppose you brought in any -- clothes?",
  "Right, well, uh -- I kept some in the -- uh -- Archives, uh, in my office.",
  "S-since I've been --  Fine.",
  "End recording, I suppose."
