  "Are you going to walk this slow the whole way?",
  "Perhaps... that's because you didn't seem to like what I had to say.",
  "Perhaps I was just trying to make things feel... familiar?",
  "You'd have it a lot more quickly if you didn't keep stopping.",
  "And the book breaks?",
  "And it's nothing to do with the fact that any lost souls in our area also get a break from their torment? Hmmm?",
  "Actually, I find it very reassuring.",
  "Did *who* suffer?",
  "I did it in his sleep.",
  "He'd always been accommodating, so... I wanted to honour his wishes.",
  "And what of his victims? The people whose lives he destroyed?",
  "No. You didn't.",
  "Less so than last time you asked.",
  "We're close now. Just a few more streets.",
  "Oh come on, Martin. You didn't really expect him to find us before we got here, did you?",
  "We have a sizable lead, and the camera too, don't forget. Besides, even if he did 'ride to your rescue', what then? Would you explain to him that you're here of your own free will?",
  "Oh, it's blackmail, is it? Offering you a way out of all this?",
  "And you believed me, which was very gracious of you.",
  "Why not? I didn't *lie* to you, I do have another option for you. One that means neither of you need to die or be consumed by any dark power.",
  "But it's much better if you see it for yourselves. And he would not have come willingly. He needs to think he's coming for you.",
  "In a way, perhaps. But I guarantee that being here in person is something very different.",
  "No. I said we wouldn't *need* one. We have plenty of tapes.",
  "Ah, I forget. You've never actually been here before, have you?",
  "Well? What do you think?",
  "Just a house?",
  "What were you expecting?",
  "We'll see what we can do.",
  "[Dramatically] Step into my parlour.",
  "Do take a seat.",
  "I've written you a statement. I would like for you to read it.",
  "Then we sit here in silence until the Archivist arrives. But I would suggest you do read it. I believe you'll find it... illuminating.",
  "Oh, it's so much more than a crack now. It's an aching hole, a gaping wound in the very fabric of our world.",
  "Not quite yet.",
  "Dramatic enough for you?",
  "[Wistful] It's a real shame, you know. I was so looking forward to filling you with spiders.",
  "They would have hollowed you out, and worn you like a cheery jumper!",
  "That's the thing about webs. People get so caught up on how intricate they are, how perfectly constructed. They never consider how flexible they can be. The sort of storm they need to weather. You can't be precious about a *single* strand.",
  "It's such a shame. There was a time when I was certain you had what it takes to join us.",
  "Because you always managed to get what you wanted through smiles and shrugs and stammerings that weren't nearly as awkward as they seemed.",
  "But I didn't foresee how deep you would fall into The Lonely. Or how far the Archivist would go to get you back. It made things... awkward.",
  "[Strained] Because... explaining things, giving answers, like this... it's not what I am. It's difficult, against my nature.",
  "And I'm trying to practice.",
  "Why do you think?",
  "I was going to snatch you away. Lure you both into this web, and then take you. Drive him to despair, so that when you returned to him, bulging, and talking in a thousand tiny voices, it would drive him to a final push.",
  "Because if I do... you'll do as I ask.",
  "He's nearly here.",
  "Let's make the setting a little more... appropriate, shall we?",
  "You said you wanted something more \"dramatic\", right?",
  "Further than you can possibly imagine.",
  "What do you think? It's for your safety. So you don't do anything... unpredictable. I'd hate for you to fall.",
  "As long as he listens to me first, it won't matter.",
  "A fine material to spin a web with, don't you think?",
  "Oh Martin. You have no idea who's listening, do you?"
 ],
 "MARTIN": [
  "Are you going to stay silent the whole way?",
  "No, it's because you weren't really *saying* anything, were you? It was all just ominous foreshadowing again.",
  "Perhaps the whole 'answer a question with a question' thing is wearing a bit thin. Besides which it's a bit late to play coy. You promised me an actual straight answer.",
  "Hey, this is your magic bubble. You're the one making it so that we're, like, actually walking, walking all the way to Oxford. So sorry I've got to sit down occasionally, like a human.",
  "It's not like you're entertaining company.",
  "So what if it does? Is that a problem?",
  "Great, because I'm still going to need to rest. Some of these houses have actual beds, and I haven't slept on a mattress since Sa--",
  "Did he suffer?",
  "Just... answer the question.",
  "That's a shame.",
  "I mean... he seemed nice. To us at least.",
  "I can't speak for them. I didn't know them, did I?",
  "[Sighs] Is it much further?",
  "Could you just try answering a question properly? Just once?",
  "Oh. Uhh... Huh. Um...",
  "[Unconvincing] N... no...",
  "I mean, that's a pretty generous way to describe being blackmailed.",
  "You said if I told John or waited then you'd leave, and I'd never know.",
  "[Sputters slightly] I shouldn't have.",
  "Oh, but you can't just tell me or John. Oh no, no, that would be far too straightforward.",
  "He can see literally everything. I'm sure he probably knows it already.",
  "Hey, is that -- ? You told me not to bring a tape recorder.",
  "But then --",
  "This is it?",
  "It's... I-I mean, it's, um...",
  "Well... well, yeah.",
  "I don't know, like... something a bit more dramatic, I guess.",
  "[Warily] So... What now?",
  "And if I don't?",
  "Screw it. Fine.",
  "Once there was a house, a building that, for all it *might* have looked like those around it, was not the same.",
  "It didn't start with the house. It was here long before any might have thought of it as a home.",
  "Once, there was a patch of land, not quite as firm in this reality as that which surrounded it.",
  "It's not about the land. Mud and soil has no part in what is there.",
  "Once, there was a point in space that did not *quite* obey all those petty rules that decide what can be allowed to happen in a world.",
  "It's not a point in space. The Earth spins and hurtles through the darkness, but it still carries it along.",
  "Let us simply say that once there was a place. A place where the universe had... cracked.",
  "Eventually, the long-awaited knife in the dark did indeed find its way into the belly of Geoffrey Neckam. But by then his only meaningful work was done, and another, altogether grander plan, was now in motion.",
  "It was no easy task, keeping the place close through the ages, working all the while to weaken that crack, luring in the servants of other powers, and so in the resulting clash, pressing ever harder against the edges of our reality.",
  "An opening into, we believe, other worlds than this tired old thing.",
  "It was not wide enough to allow true passage, not yet, save for the odd accident. But it was wide enough for what we now intended...",
  "A crack in reality?",
  "And a gateway to other dimensions.",
  "So this is what you wanted me to see?",
  "E-- Wh-- Excuse me?",
  "Uh, right. But, since you're *telling* me I can assume you're not going to now, right?",
  "R-Right, yeah, but a-a-again, because you didn't really answer me, um, filling me with spiders isn't a strand of your web now, right? Um. I-I just want us to be, heh, absolutely clear on this.",
  "R-R-Right, thanks. Sorry. S-S-Sorry to interrupt, just, just checking.",
  "What? Because I like spiders? Well, used to.",
  "Why are you telling me all this?",
  "Okay, let's try a different question. What was your plan?",
  "[Frustrated] Yeah, but why?",
  "Oh, will we?",
  "Hey, just... ah, hah, p-put the camera down, okay?",
  "Wh-What? No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait... wait --",
  "[Distorted] Ooooh shit...",
  "That's a long way down",
  "Oi! W-What're you -- ? Urgh! Urgh. What i--? What -- ? What is this?",
  "When John gets here, he is going to kill you.",
  "What? All this time, through all of this, it, it was just you *spying* on us?"
