  "Ah, of course!",
  "Come in, come in!",
  "Did you sleep well?",
  "Have you had something to eat?",
  "Annabelle said she'd shown you the pantry.",
  "About seventy-one hours, by my clock.",
  "How're you feeling?",
  "Well, you have, haven't you?",
  "Annabelle tells me you work for The Eye.",
  "[Friendly chuckles] I like this one.",
  "Come on, sit down, have a drink.",
  "You can indeed.",
  "Martin, was it?",
  "It's about ten in the morning.",
  "More or less.",
  "Even in my little bubble of peace, I find drinking after dark leads to some rather morbid thoughts.",
  "I just told you, it's my little bubble.",
  "My silver lining on an otherwise cloudy day.",
  "Now tell me, do you know why there's a tape recorder here?",
  "I noticed it just now, but I don't believe I actually own one.",
  "Did you carry it in?",
  "Things shouldn't be able to manifest in here like that.",
  "In that case, we shall leave it to be.",
  "It's hardly valuable, and it's probably best not to upset whatever it might be involved with.",
  "Besides, I have no secrets to hide.",
  "I am an open book.",
  "I do like this one!",
  "Now you mention it, you actually remind me of Jurgen a bit.",
  "In his younger days of course.",
  "You're sure you won't have a drink?",
  "We definitely had some tea around here somewhere?",
  "Oh, you know Annabelle?",
  "[Sarcastically] No, I assumed the thread holding her head together was due to a childhood knitting accident.",
  "Of course I know she's with The Web.",
  "And even if it did, what good would it do?",
  "It's an odd situation, but not a complicated one.",
  "Shortly after I decided to stay here, she arrived.",
  "Wandered in from the chaos out there, and told me she was going to stay with me.",
  "I didn't get this far by pitting myself against The Web, so I welcomed her in.",
  "And sometimes she cooks.",
  "I don't know what you want me to say.",
  "It's a big house and I don't see her much.",
  "Can't even say which corner she's made her nest in.",
  "Whatever she's doing, all I can do is hope it doesn't wreck my little oasis.",
  "And if it does, then I hope that by keeping her in good graces she'll at least do me the courtesy of killing me first.",
  "Anyway, let us talk of happier things.",
  "Or perhaps just take a moment to enjoy not being out there.",
  "You are, of course, welcome to stay as long as you like.",
  "[Slightly curt]\u00a0I didn't *find* anything.",
  "I made it.",
  "The look on your face!",
  "Look, he's so confused!",
  "Your powers won't work here, Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "The Eye can't see this place.",
  "Ah, no need for the suspicion, I'm not going to hurt you.",
  "You're quite safe.",
  "I'll tell you soon enough.",
  "Like I said, I have no secrets.",
  "But it will be in my own time.",
  "You know, Gertrude once used that little trick to ask if I was trying to sell her a forgery.",
  "Admittedly I was, so I don't hold a grudge, but I didn't much care for the experience.",
  "Anyway, for now, just relax, and no doubt I'll get there eventually.",
  "I haven't had anyone to talk to properly in months.",
  "She keeps mostly to herself, and when she does talk, it's usually more of the sinister monologue variety, or cryptically telling me I've got 'guests'.",
  "So what's it like out there?",
  "I assume the Archivist must be rather a powerful position, since you seem to be travelling through it pretty freely.",
  "I'm sorry, you're quite right -- it's inappropriate.",
  "I have spent the last decade preparing for this to happen.",
  "Not just something like this, but almost exactly this situation.",
  "There was every chance, in fact the great likelihood, that I was wasting my time, and throwing away years of my life on a ridiculous precaution.",
  "But I was right.",
  "And now here I am, safe, warm and comfortable while out there the whole world screams.",
  "I don't mean to sound.",
  "Then I apologise.",
  "I'm just not sure I can fully communicate the sense of.",
  "of *vindication* that I feel.",
  "All those long nights I spent wondering if I was paranoid or overreacting.",
  "I am here.",
  "And I am safe.",
  "So what of you two?",
  "Wh-Where are you going?",
  "You seem to be travelling with some purpose.",
  "She said you were travelling to the Tower.",
  "The Panopticon, she called it, whatever that might be.",
  "She didn't say what for.",
  "[Suspiciously] Nothing that might cause me trouble, I hope?",
  "You are right, to a point.",
  "I would welcome a return to the real world.",
  "To be the only man to weather the greatest disaster in history of reality utterly unharmed.",
  "What an achievement that would be, quite the boast.",
  "But alas no, I can't help you.",
  "I have nothing to offer.",
  "Well, except perhaps for some.",
  "I have food, drink, a few luxuries.",
  "But none of that would help you out there.",
  "And I'm certainly not going to follow you.",
  "No, I think the best thing I can do is to welcome you to stay in my sanctuary as long as you wish.",
  "It gets easier with practice.",
  "I haven't had guests since the world ended!",
  "Oh, saying that, I suppose there was that insect thing that stumbled in here a month or so back.",
  "Some creature of the Crawling Rot.",
  "Anyway, it didn't actually make it into the house before Annabelle managed to get rid of it, so I refuse to count it as a guest.",
  "Of course, I can't actually stop things crossing the border into my hideaway, as *you* both discovered.",
  "Another reason I'm content to leave Annabelle to whatever schemes she might be weaving.",
  "[Chuckling] Look at him.",
  "Not three days without his master spooning knowledge into his head, and he can't bear it!",
  "I thought ignorance was meant to be bliss.",
  "Fine, I'll tell you how it happened.",
  "But you must sit quietly while I tell you.",
  "My story is not a long one.",
  "Not the parts that you care about, at least.",
  "The powers, I first learned about from Jurgen Leitner.",
  "You're familiar with him?",
  "Then I don't need to explain further.",
  "When I say I was one of his assistants, you know exactly the kind of education that would be.",
  "Terrifying, fascinating, misguided.",
  "The man was a genius and an idiot.",
  "It didn't take me long to see what he was blind to his whole life: that trying to control the Fears was a good way to get yourself killed, or worse.",
  "I left long before he got what was coming to him, and tried to forget what I knew.",
  "I lived my life, and I lived it well, Successful, wealthy, and a little bit feared.",
  "Smuggler to the rich and famous.",
  "There wasn't an art dealer or curator out there who didn't pretend not to know me.",
  "But the trouble is, once you've seen backstage, it's hard to believe in the show anymore.",
  "You understand, I'm sure.",
  "You can never quite shake off the desire to have a peek.",
  "To see what's waiting in the wings.",
  "When I first stumbled across one of the cursed objects, I recognised what it was immediately.",
  "It took the form of a leather pouch, filled with 1888 Morgan silver dollars.",
  "It was aligned to The Slaughter and.",
  "well, let us call it 'blood money' and talk no more of the grisly details.",
  "Selling them, well, it went very badly for the buyer.",
  "But not for me.",
  "I walked away unharmed, and with a healthy profit and counted myself lucky.",
  "And then it happened again.",
  "This time it was a painting: a drab English pastoral that pulled you into The Lonely.",
  "Again, I made a lot of money and remained untouched.",
  "It's the sort of thing to set a man thinking about his life, you understand?",
  "I began to think hard about the world, about my place within it, and about fear.",
  "About the figure of the merchant, the trader who deals in strange and dangerous goods, how it can be found in so many myths and fables, dealing in second-hand nightmares.",
  "And how rarely the merchant themself is ever punished in those stories.",
  "I would love to pretend that it was out of self-preservation that I committed to my new trade, but that would be mostly a lie.",
  "To tell you the truth, I got a real kick out of playing my role.",
  "To think of myself as a purveyor of curses, walking softly through the most dangerous edges of reality so that the rich and arrogant could buy their own doom.",
  "Sometimes people would come to me for solutions, protections or talismans to ward off the attention they had already called down on themselves.",
  "I sometimes did what I could to help, but I had to be careful.",
  "I could never afford to forget who I actually was working for.",
  "And do you know what?",
  "I managed to walk that tightrope for decades without falling.",
  "You know, I think there were times when I was perhaps skirting close to The Stranger, but I kept my name prominent and, well.",
  "[chuckles] I'm not exactly a small personality.",
  "Anonymity just wouldn't have suited me.",
  "But the years, they wear on you, and as I talked to more and more people versed in that secret world, more acolytes and would-be cultists about rituals and destinies, I began to come to a conclusion.",
  "As the number of people in the world grew, and the amount of fear grew with it, I began to become convinced that it was only a matter of time before one of them succeeded.",
  "Before the world was transformed into.",
  "Well, you'd know better than me.",
  "So I began to plan for my.",
  "I spent most of my fortune preparing.",
  "Some on supplies, but mostly hunting down an artifact that I hoped might give me some.",
  "One I had sold right at the start of my career: an old broken camera.",
  "One that through some quirk had the ability to hide you from the Powers.",
  "It was in the possession of another scared old man, one who had long been running from his own supernatural debts.",
  "I believe it operates as a sort of, er, battery, charging itself on all the quiet worries that come from living in hiding, and then when the sanctuary collapses, all that fear flows out at once.",
  "No doubt, if my oasis breaks before I die, The Eye will get quite the feast from me, but in this new world I would hope it has other things to keep itself busy.",
  "Anyway, it took a lot of resources to find it again, and even more to retrieve it.",
  "Staging my death was a comparative, erm, afterthought -- in some ways just a happy accident.",
  "And so I waited, and lived out my days in comfort.",
  "For the longest time I thought that, well, maybe I had simply entered normal retirement really dramatically.",
  "I was right.",
  "Both about the world and about the camera.",
  "It hid me from The Eye, which, in the new order of reality, also protects where I am from the hellscape all around us.",
  "And when I realised that the power moves with the camera.",
  "Well, let's just say I loaded up a truckload of supplies, and went on some journeys of my own before I found *this* place.",
  "No reason not to live out the apocalypse in style.",
  "In the end, I find myself quite happy.",
  "I have supplies for a good few years, and then I plan to take my own life.",
  "I think perhaps that's the greatest blessing the camera can bestow.",
  "I can die here.",
  "Escape this place.",
  "Not yet, of course, and maybe the wine will do me in before I have to take matters into my own hands, but still, it remains a comfort.",
  "Anyway, no more stories, I think.",
  "Let us relax, and talk and drink.",
  "And not worry about who might be.",
  "Ah, you are off, then?",
  "You are sure you won't stay a little longer?",
  "You're more than welcome.",
  "Ah, such a shame.",
  "And you're sure I can't give you a little something for the road?",
  "Well, best of luck I suppose.",
  "And if, in the end, you can't save the world.",
  "you know where I am.",
  "Ah, of course.",
  "What a shame.",
  "Well, then I guess it really is goodbye.",
  "Don't be Strangers!"
