  "Statement of Julia Montauk, regarding the actions and motivations of her father, the serial killer Robert Montauk. Original statement given December 3rd, 2002. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "Eventually I woke up. The house was quiet and empty. I had missed the start of school by hours, but that was fine, because I didn't want to leave the house. I just sat in the living room, silent and still.",
  "I sometimes think back to that day, and wonder if my father left it deliberately. He'd been so careful for so many years, and then he just forgot? I knew about the dangers, but something inside me couldn't resist going in.",
  "I did what I was told. I went up to my room and lay in bed, trying to sleep. The air was heavy somehow, and in the end I spent the night staring out of the window at the street below. I was waiting for something, though I didn't know what.",
  "The house on York Road is still inhabited, though the current owners pulled down the shed over a decade ago and replaced it with a patio."
