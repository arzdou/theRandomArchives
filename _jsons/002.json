  "Statement of Joshua Gillespie, regarding his time in possession of an apparently empty wooden casket. Original statement given November 22nd, 1998. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.",
  "There was nothing to be done. I'd made my decision not to open it, and this certainly did *not* make me want to reconsider that. So I just went back to my bedroom, put on some music and turned it up loud enough to drown out the sounds.",
  "I wasn't surprised to see them, as I say, but they actually seemed quite surprised to see me. John had to take a second to look me up and down, almost in disbelief, as I asked if they'd come to collect their coffin.",
  "That was the last I heard of it. I got a new job and moved to London shortly afterwards, and now I just try not to think about it too much."
