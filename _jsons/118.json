  "There's plenty more on the pile.",
  "I can't hear you.",
  "There's -- a door in the way.",
  "Then maybe you should *make* time.",
  "I thought you had a key.",
  "I'm not going anywhere.",
  "I would hurry, though, if I were you.",
  "That one, that one was Benjamin Hatendi.",
  "You weren't fast enough with the key!",
  "Oh, I'm sorry, can you not just *look* into my head?",
  "Read my mind?",
  "Too busy trying to keep an eye on everything?",
  "I just thought I'd, you know, drop a couple of ideas in the old suggestion box.",
  "Turns out my suggestion is.",
  "Maybe I just thought it might hurt.",
  "Oh, so that's it, isn't it.",
  "Martin's just acting out.",
  "I mean, Daisy's a \"rabid dog,\" and Melanie's a potential killer, Tim's a -- a *rogue element,* but Martin, oh Martin's just acting out.",
  "He'll have a cry, and a lie down, and feel much better.",
  "Sorry, I'm not -- keeping you from the show, am I?",
  "Well -- well you head back.",
  "I'll keep myself busy here.",
  "Albrecht von Closen is next, I think.",
  "He's quite an old one.",
  "Should go up very quickly.",
  "You think I'm doing this for him?",
  "Is it so hard to believe that I hate you as well?",
  "You think I'm what -- I'm, I'm, I'm, um, blind?",
  "I don't get to be angry?",
  "I don't get to burn things?",
  "Just, just run around, making tea, while everyone else gets to actually have feelings?",
  "Maybe there isn't one.",
  "Looks like it wants to know what's going on.",
  "What, you don't want him hearing your big evil speech?",
  "* Right, yeah.",
  "Like the dignity of being trapped in your flat by *worms*, or sleeping in the Archives clutching a corkscrew, or, or fetching drinks for the *thing* that murdered your friend without you even noticing.",
  "Laughing, at all their little jokes, then being led to wander impossible corridors for *weeks.",
  "*Not* even *close.",
  "* Because, I --  I've been thinking.",
  "It's not like you got this all-seeing thing recently.",
  "You've had it the whole time.",
  "I remember the way you looked at Sasha after the attack.",
  "You *knew* it wasn't her.",
  "And I reckon you knew Prentiss was lurking under the Institute, too, and you did nothing.",
  "What, like with Melanie?",
  "Just that *perfect* bit of information to leave me a wreck?",
  "Well, I hope you've got something better than that pathetic dig at my feelings for John.",

  "So I assume this is.",
  "what's it called.",
  "A cry for attention.",
  "No more than you're hurting yourself by acting out.",
  "And if you're trying to convince me otherwise, then you are failing.",
  "Now, if you're quite done, I am very busy.",
  "Did John put you up to this?",
  "It's just the sort of half-baked scheme he'd come up with, and I am well aware that you'd do just about anything for him.",
  "And I don't need to read your mind for that one.",
  "It's just hard to imagine that you would act on it.",
  "You've made that quite clear.",
  "Please get to the point, Martin.",
  "Maybe you're just wasting my time.",
  "That puts me in a..",
  "You might want to turn the tape off, Martin.",
  "You know John listens to all of them.",
  "Just wanted to spare you the small amount of dignity you have left.",
  "Are you done.",
  "Let's just get this over with, shall we?",
  "It's baffling, really.",
  "Such loyalty to someone who really treats you very badly.",
  "You know, I really should have gone for that.",
  "Found something that would finally manage to shatter that precious image you have of him.",
  "But, as you say I am *very* busy at the moment.",
  "So I suppose I'll have to go with what I had prepared.",
  "She's always been.",
  "difficult, hasn't she.",
  "You take care of her for years, feed her, clean up after her, and now, with her condition degrading even further, *she* is the one that asked to be moved into a home.",
  "To have it left to the nurses.",
  "*She's* the one that refuses your visits.",
  "You know the reason.",
  "Your mother simply hates you.",
  "You just don't know why.",
  "It's not your fault, though I know that isn't any consolation.",
  "Just bad luck, really.",
  "How old were you when your father left?",
  "When your mother began to sicken, and he decided he was done with you both.",
  "Not old enough to remember him with any great clarity, *especially* when your mother refused to keep any pictures of him.",
  "She never recovered from that betrayal.",
  "He just tore her heart right out and took it with him.",
  "The thing is, though, Martin.",
  "If you ever *do* want to know *exactly* what your father looked like.",
  "All you have to do is look in a mirror.",
  "The resemblance is quite uncanny.",
  "The face of the man she hates, who destroyed her life, watching over her.",

  "You want to know what she sees when she looks at you?",
