  "I still don't think we should have brought it.",
  "You're unpacked then?",
  "Yeah, it's -- it's not exactly the Ritz.",
  "Or --  Or it is, and she just cleaned it up *really* well.",
  "Are we? --",
  "Are we... safe here?",
  "Some-- Somehow I don't think *Daisy* will be worried about *jurisdictions*.",
  "And if she does?",
  "You think they're still out there?",
  "Oh -- Oh, no, not yet. I was actually going to go head down into the village to pick something up?",
  "Maybe give Basira a call to check in, because Daisy apparently couldn't pick a safehouse with a signal.",
  "It -- might. Maybe.",
  "You'll be okay here?",
  "Oh, same as last week.",
  "I mean, they've finished all the interviews? Apparently they're calling it a \"terror attack.\"",
  "They're not really talking to her about it? Sectioned or not, I guess *ex-*police only gets you so far.",
  "I don't know how hard they're looking, to be honest?",
  "Basira said a few of them got lost in the tunnels for over a day --",
  "-- and -- it's not like the promise of an old man's corpse is much of a motivator.",
  "Still, she did manage to talk them out of burning the whole place to the ground? -- and, ooh, actually, that reminds me, um --",
  "Yes. Basira said last week she'd send some up as soon as the Archives weren't a crime scene.",
  "And she wasn't sure which ones you've read already, so she, she just said she'd send a bunch.",
  "She didn't mention it? -- But I didn't check it until after the call.",
  "I assume it's her attempt at a-a, a varied diet? Eating your greens, you know?",
  "Well, as *fun* as listening to you monologue is --",
  "-- I will give you some privacy. Go for a walk.",
  "*Obviously* I'm going to tell you if I see any good *cows*.",
  "Wake up. Wake up. Wait, John, John, John, WAKE UP!",
  "I, I don't, I don't know; everything--  It's all gone wrong!",
  "No, no, no -- don't, don't go outside. It's-- It's *real* bad.",
  "I don't know if it's just *here*, or --",
  "John. John, I'm scared."

 "ARCHIVIST": [
  "Just -- Making sure it works.",
  "Oh, it's better than no warning at all.  Especially if I'm trying not to, uh... See things, you know?",
  "Hm? *Oh, yes*; much as I can be without any wardrobes to speak of, at least.",
  "Yeah, well, it technically still belongs to Daisy, so --  I'm just glad it's not some sort of kill room.",
  "Safe as anywhere. If Elias wanted to find us, I imagine he could, but -- I doubt the police will be able to. If nothing else, I'm hoping there'd be some -- jurisdiction complications, in Scotland?",
  "I --  I don't think she'd come here.",
  "Doesn't look like this place has been used for *years*.",
  "Well. At least we'll know where she is.",
  "Besides, I'm more worried about the other Hunters. Or the -- Sasha thing. Last I heard, they still hadn't found any bodies.  A lot of destruction, a lot of *blood.*  But that's it.",
  "Hopefully a *long way* out there.  But I think we're okay.",
  "Not much in the way of food, is there?",
  "I think that's rather the point.",
  "Anyways, don't tell me the phonebox down there doesn't appeal to your retro aesthetic.",
  "I'll be fine.",
  "How was she?",
  "Institute still crawling with police?",
  "Doesn't surprise me.  Appropriate, in a way.",
  "Does she know who they're looking to blame?",
  "Does she know if they've found the old prison yet -- the Panopticon, Eli--  *Magnus*'s body.",
  "Ah, these, these are the statements.",
  "There -- There are tapes in here, as well. D-Did she say anything about tapes?",
  "Probably.  I'm sure it'll work fine.",
  "Let me know if you see any good cows.",
  "Right. Statement of Hazel Rutter regarding a fire in her childhood home. Original statement given August 9th, 1992. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Archivist. Statement begins.",
  "Apologies for the deception, but I wanted to make sure you started reading, so I thought it best not to announce myself.",
  "I'm assuming you're alone; you always did prefer to read your statements in private.  I wouldn't try too hard to stop reading; there's every likelihood you'll just hurt yourself. So just listen.",
  "Now, shall we turn the page and try again?",
  "Statement of Jonah Magnus regarding Jonathan Sims, The Archivist.",
  "I hope you'll forgive me the self-indulgence, but I have worked so very hard for this moment, a culmination of *two centuries* of work. It's rare that you get the chance to monologue through another, and you can't tell me you're not curious.",
  "Why *does* a man seek to destroy the world?",
  "It is an awful thing to know about yourself, but the *freedom*, John, the freedom of it all. I have dedicated my life to handing the world to these Dread Powers all for my own gain, and I feel... nothing but satisfaction in that choice.",
  "I am to be a *king* of a ruined world, and I shall never die.",
  "I believe there are far more people in this world that would take that bargain than you would ever guess. And I have beaten all of them.",
  "I began to worry that if one of them successfully attempted their ritual, then I would be as much a victim as any, trapped in the nightmare landscape of a twisted world.",
  "Beyond that, I was getting older, and mortality began to weigh more heavily on my mind. How much in this world is done because we fear death, the last and greatest terror?",
  "I convinced Smirke to work on Millbank, leading him to design it as a temple to all the Fears in equilibrium, such that my own modifications to the design of the Panopticon went... unremarked.",
  "It. Took. Years, for the dread of the prisoners to fully suffuse the place, and I was an old man before I made my first attempt at the Watcher's Crown, sat in the center of that colossal eye, the great ring of cells encircling me like a coronet.",
  "It was... flawed, of course, as all Smirke's rituals were, and none of the inmates survived as the power I attempted to harness shook the building almost to pieces, and the murky swamp upon which the prison was built consumed it.",
  "But it left me a gift: For sat in that watchtower, I could see *everything* I turned my mind to.",
  "I'll not bore you with details of my bodies and failures through those intervening years. Suffice to say I kept busy, both planning my own next attempt, and doing my best to stymie those others who tried versions of their own.",
  "Surely my interpretation of the Watcher's Crown had been incomplete; there had been some element of the ritual I had overlooked.",
  "It was not until I met Gertrude Robinson that things began to really come into focus.",
  "But Gertrude was unlike any other Archivist. She simply did not care about compiling experiences or collecting the fears of others. She was driven to stop those who served the Powers.",
  "I once asked her what drove her, what had started her down that path. She told me the Desolation had killed her cat.",
  "I don't know if she was joking, and, to be honest, I could never bring myself to look into her mind and find out for sure.",
  "In any case, Gertrude's ruthless efficiency in derailing and collapsing rituals threw into stark relief a question that had been bothering me for almost a hundred and fifty years: In the whole span of humanity, why had nobody ever succeeded?",
  "Perhaps there were a long line of Gertrude Robinsons throughout history, but I found that hard to credit. Could it be, then, that there was something in the very concept of the rituals that meant they *couldn't* succeed?",
  "She was clearly having similar thoughts in that last year, all of which culminated with the People's Church.",
  "Knowing Gertrude, I'm sure she had a backup plan if she had miscalculated -- but she had not. The ritual failed. And all at once, I realized what had to be done.",
  "You see, the thing about the Fears is that they can never be truly separated from each other. When does the fear of sudden violence transition into the fear of hunted prey? When does the mask of the Stranger become the deception of the Spiral?",
  "Even those that seem to exist in direct opposition rely on each other for their definition as much as up relies on down.",
  "To try and create a world with only the Buried makes as much sense as trying to conceive a world with only down.",
  "And there was only one being that could possibly serve as a lynchpin for this new ritual: The Archivist. A position that had so recently become vacant, thanks to Gertrude's ill-timed retirement plans.",
  "Because the thing about the Archivist is that -- well, it's a bit of a misnomer.",
  "It might, perhaps, be better named: The Archive.",
  "Because you do *not* administer and preserve the records of fear, John. You *are* a record of fear, both in mind as you walk the shuddering record of each statement, and in body as the Powers each leave their mark upon you.",
  "You are a living chronicle of terror.",
  "Do you see where I'm going, John?",
  "It does tickle me, that in this world of would-be occult dynasties and ageless monsters, the Chosen One is simply that -- someone I chose. It's not in your blood, or your soul, or your *destiny*. It's just in your own, rotten luck.",
  "I reasoned if you couldn't survive a single encounter, you were unlikely to make it through all fourteen. So, when Jane Prentiss attacked, I watched eagerly, one hand on the gas release from the start.",
  "You acquitted yourself well enough, so I decided to see how far you would get, though I waited until the worms were in you before I pulled the lever. I needed to make sure you felt that fear *all the way to your bones*.",
  "Admittedly, given the advent of the Unknowing, I needn't have bothered. But what's the old saying about hindsight?",
  "More important to me was Sasha's encounter with the Distortion. If *it* had taken an interest, then I very much wanted it to cross your path.",
  "So I found one of its current victims and convinced her to make a statement.",
  "Poor Helen. I actually had to put her in a taxi myself, she was getting so lost in those narrow London side streets.",
  "It worked, though.",
  "Between the stabbing and at least two desperate flights into its doors -- you're marked very deeply by the Spiral.",
  "Jurgen Leitner was a surprise, of course, and I was forced to improvise. I had no idea how much Gertrude would have told him, and he could very easily have derailed everything if you learned too much too fast.",
  "I... justified it to myself saying I was going to have to send you out into the world anyway, if you were to encounter more of the Powers, but I can't honestly pretend it wasn't a... rather rash move.",
  "Still. I'd requested Detective Tonner be assigned to the case when they found Gertrude's body in the hope that having a Hunter in the mix would eventually lead to a confrontation, and setting you up as a killer certainly hastened that.",
  "Then it was just a matter of feeding you statements to lead you to a few Avatars I thought were likely to harm you -- but probably would stop short of actually killing you.",
  "Jude served her purpose exactly as I had hoped, as did our dearly departed Mr. Crew, marking you for the Desolation and the Vast.",
  "Honestly, I had -- nothing to do with Melanie and her *Slaughter* adventure, but when I saw the situation, I made sure to trap her here, so when her rage bubbled over you would be right there, a ready target.",
  "I didn't foresee the mark coming from surgery gone wrong, but it was a very pleasant surprise.",
  "As it was, it was *just right*, and once again, you came through with *flying colors*.",
  "By this point, your abilities were coming along in leaps and bounds, and I was concerned that meeting face-to-face might end up with you --  -- Knowing something you shouldn't.",
  "I had initially planned to go into hiding, but when your colleagues surprised me with the police, well. It was simple enough to cut a deal.",
  "All that remained, then, were the Dark, the Flesh, the Buried, and the Lonely.",
  "I was a little put out when that *idiot* Jared Hopworth misinterpreted my letters and attacked the Institute too soon, before you were even out of the hospital, but then -- Ho, you should have see my face when you voluntarily went to him.",
  "I couldn't see what happened in there, of course, but given how you came out, I'm *very* sure it counts as a mark.",
  "I suspected the coffin might turn up again, and once it did, it was simply a matter of getting any, uh... *restraining factors* you might have had flying off on a wild goose chase, and waiting.",
  "Honestly, Detective Tonner has been proving *invaluable* through this process. I'd been racking my brains for months about what I could use to lure you in.",
  "And, of course, I knew the Dark Sun was just sitting there waiting. So when it came time, I just whipped up another apocalypse and sent you on your merry way.",
  "Then all that remained was the Lonely.",
  "Poor Peter. He really should have left well enough alone.  Or just done what I'd asked in the first place.",
  "Ah well. He knew what I was attempting, and was very unwilling to cooperate until I made him a little wager about Martin.",
  "Of course, he had no way of knowing that, in addition to setting you up for the final mark, he was giving you all the tools you needed to escape from it.",
  "How *is* Martin, by the way? He looks well. You will keep an eye on him when all this is over, won't you? He's earned *that.*",
  "And there, I think, we are brought just about up to date. I have enjoyed our little trip down memory lane, but past here lies only impatience.",
  "You are prepared. You are ready. You are *marked*. The power of the Ceaseless Watcher flows through you, and the time of our victory is here.",
  "Don't worry, John. You'll get used to it here, in the world that we have made.",
  "Now.  Repeat after me.",
  "*You who watch and know and understand none. You who listen and hear and will not comprehend. You who wait and wait and drink in all that is not yours by right.*",
  "<u>Come to us in your wholeness.</u>",
  "*<u>Come to us in your perfection.</u>*",
  "*Bring all that is fear and all that is terror and all that is the awful dread that crawls and chokes and blinds and falls and twists and leaves and hides and weaves and burns and hunts and rips and bleeds and dies!*",
  "*Come to us.*",
  "*I -- OPEN -- <u>THE DOOR</u>!*",
  "Uh-- Wh-- *Martin?*",
  "Wha-- Wh--  Oh god. What-- What happened?",
  "Help me up!",
  "No. *No,* it's everywhere. They're all here now.  I can feel *all* of it.",
  "The whole world is afraid, Martin. Because of me.",
  "And The Watcher --",
  "-- drinks it all in.",
  "Look at the sky, Martin. Look at the *sky*. It's looking back."
