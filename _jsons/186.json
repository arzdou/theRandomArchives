  "So this is it, then.",
  "[Calling] Hello!? Anybody!?",
  "Well at least I can still remember everything this time. And no more bloody chairs.",
  "It's weird, though. Never actually been anywhere like this. That said, it is kind of... huh...",
  "Yeah. God, I hated studying that. It was all just so...",
  "So what? That's where we are?",
  "D'you have an umbrella?",
  "[Sigh] -- an indulgence",
  "So what is this? You're part of me so you know everything about me? Is that it?",
  "Because you're part of my domain?",
  "Some sort of cosmic joke about 'being alone with my thoughts', I assume?",
  "So, instead I get to talk to myself?",
  "Okay, so if I'm *so* desperate not to be alone, why isn't John here? Hmm? He can find me anywhere.",
  "[Dubious] Oh yeah?",
  "And what do you mean by that?",
  "You've no idea what you're talking about!",
  "I -- No, a --",
  "[Resigned] It's not that.",
  "No, I just... I'm ashamed to let him see this place, alright. To see what -- I don't know, what *feeds* me?",
  "What do you mean?",
  "Well I... hmm.",
  "That's... a good point.",
  "Ohhhhh, I see.",
  "I get it. So that's your deal. You tell me what I want to hear to try and get me to stay.",
  "[Archly] Oh really? I thought you said you were me?",
  "We have our moments, I guess.",
  "You won't try to stop me?",
  "So why do you want me to stay then? Hmm?",
  "It's not healthy.",
  "We *could* talk to John about it.",
  "There's nothing wrong with comforting people.",
  "Even so, I could murder a cuppa. I doubt you've got a kettle out here though.",
  "Wait that's... wait, is that...?",
  "Eurgh. Oolong. Of course. Of course! Whenever I asked a question she didn't like, or she wanted to stop the conversation --",
  "And it always had to be that bloody oolong. Eurgh.",
  "Yes, it was.",
  "Oh, you think?",
  "She wasn't well.",
  "She was still my mum! Our mum. Whatever!",
  "If we're glad, why do I feel so...",
  "That's... That's not --",
  "Stress is a proper factor in a stroke --",
  "I brought Jane Prentiss to the Institute!",
  "If I'd done what Peter had asked... If I'd not chickened out, and just killed Elias when I had the chance...",
  "I remember it was the wrong choice.",
  "I get it, alright? But I need it. I-I choose the guilt, because...",
  "Because it motivates me to do better!",
  "Hey, to be fair, he still kind of hated me back then. I'm *really* not sure it would have been the time to take my shot.",
  "Hey! Pretty sure we love 'that guy'.",
  "I don't --",
  "It's actually not a button, so --",
  "[Angry] S-So what, okay? We should just give up? Hmm? Just stay here and curl up into a ball and just accept the world as is? Hmm? That's your big solution?",
  "I can be a real manipulative prick, you know that?",
  "So, this price. What do you think?",
  "Are we going to have to kill John?",
  "I... have thought about it. And... I won't. I don't think I could.",
  "But anything else? *Any* other price? I'll pay it.",
  "It's not his decision.",
  "I don't know, all right? I don't know.",
  "What, like with Peter and Elias?",
  "That was a proper choice?! I chose wrong!",
  "I... I'll think about it.",
  "What about the people here?",
  "I don't know. My... 'prisoners', I guess?",
  "Why haven't we talked about them?",
  "Yeah? Well, I want to now. Consider it a 'proper choice' if you like.",
  "Can I see them?",
  "I can feel them, though.",
  "Hmm. But... if this is *my* domain, can I fix that? Like, can I change things?",
  "Can you tell me about them?",
  "Do we know who they are?",
  "Tell me. Please. Like John would.",
  "I want to know the exact limits of my guilt.",
  "I'm thinking that I didn't ask for this. It's not my fault they're here.",
  "But I can't keep existing like this at their expense. It's not... it's not right. Whatever happens with Elias, W-with the rest of the world... I can't live on the misery of others.",
  "I get it, okay? I can't decide what happens to them. But... I just might be able to decide what happens to me. And... And if it comes down to it...",
  "I'll get John to destroy me like the others.",
  "I don't know. Maybe?",
  "Yeah. But... this time, it doesn't feel like despair.",
  "It feels like resolve.",
  "Thanks for the tea.",
  "So, how do I leave?",
  "I'm sure he'll find us eventually."

 "ALSO MARTIN": [
  "But that cover... those wide empty spaces. It felt right, didn't it?",
  "Right down to the monochrome.",
  "But you don't want one. We like the rain.",
  "Because it makes the sadness feel at home. It turns it from a burden into --",
  "I'm here because you're trying very hard *not* to be alone. To resist the comfort.",
  "I don't know.",
  "Look, I know what you know. Maybe I'm just a bit more... open about it.",
  "Like how you don't actually want him here? Maybe that has something to do with it?",
  "I mean, you can argue with me if you like. Seems like a bit of a waste, though.",
  "It's alright. It's hard to be vulnerable.",
  "Sure, that's part of it, but... it's not the whole thing, is it? Not really.",
  "Well, if you don't count 'memory manor', when was the last time you were even on your own?",
  "It has been a very long time since the Institute.",
  "It's okay to want a bit of space now and then. New romance is hard. And armageddon makes it even harder, never mind the fact that you're metaphorically joined at the hip thanks to the whole 'eye-lord' thing. It's okay to want some space.",
  "[Wearily] Seriously? Fine. If you don't want to engage, if you want to pretend I'm just some... temptation ghost, you go ahead. Knock yourself out. Like I said, I'm not your enemy.",
  "Right, yes. Very clever.",
  "Look, if you want to leave, you can. It's not a problem.",
  "I mean, it *really* doesn't matter to me. You leave and I'm just you again. It's all the same to me, really.",
  "Because you want to stay. Because you want to have a real *rest*. To just breathe and ... be quietly sad, I guess.",
  "Maybe not, but I'm not entirely sure what healthy options are even left, at this point.",
  "We could. But we both know that loved ones make the worst therapists. They're too wrapped up in trying to stop you hurting to actually help. But hey, we know all about that, am I right?",
  "A cup of tea isn't a resolution. At best it's a... a plaster. At worst... a muzzle.",
  "As a matter of fact, I do have a thermos.",
  "This is our domain. You're not supposed to suffer here. Well, not like the others... you know what I mean.",
  "Yeah, sorry about that. There's only so much we can do, what with the new world and everything. Even the good things get tinged with memory.",
  "Off you'd go to put the kettle on.",
  "It wasn't your fault.",
  "That's just the guilt talking.",
  "She was awful.",
  "Both things can be true.",
  "[Emphatically] And we're glad she's dead.",
  "Too much? Like I said, I'm a bit more open.",
  "Don't lie. You don't need to. Not here. It's just us.",
  "Because you feel *guilty* about *everything*.",
  "Everything that's happened to John.",
  "The end of the entire world?",
  "Really? Really? That's how you're choosing to remember it? Chickening out?",
  "You choose to remember it that way, and so the guilt --",
  "Does it though? Or... does it just keep paralysing us, make us shrink back and wait, hoping things work out? Like with John, when we thought the worms had got him.",
  "Fair. He was projecting hard. Between us, that guy's got some real issues.",
  "Yeah, and all his many, many problems.",
  "But also, you know that's not what I'm talking about. It's this, this fantasy that you have, that whatever you find at the top of the Panopticon is just going to solve everything.",
  "You do though. You daydream about it! The big climactic showdown with Elias, and then the two of you kiss, and push a button that just magically saves the world and makes everything better.",
  "I'm saying there aren't any easy solutions. We have no idea what's going to happen. Even if we make it to the tower, we don't know there'll be a fix. And if by some miracle there is, we both know the price will be awful. Just look at Melanie.",
  "We are completely out of our depth. We're responsible for everyone everywhere, and we have no idea what we're doing. The last thing we need is self-indulgent guilt on top of that.",
  "I don't know because you don't know. But it seems like something we should at least consider.",
  "John's as bad as we are. He wouldn't let it happen.",
  "Fine. So flip that round, then. What are you going to do when he tries to sacrifice himself, because you *know* he's going to try?",
  "But you *made* a decision. Your own decision. Regardless of the outcome.",
  "*We'll* think about it.",
  "What about them?",
  "Because you didn't want to think about them. So, we didn't.",
  "No. This place is about hidden, unnoticed suffering.",
  "Sure, you're aware of it, dimly. A sort of far-off, lonely terror. But there's no way for us to actually see or hear them.",
  "If you wanted to start actively tormenting them, I'm sure this place would oblige. But 'fixing' things? Making it easier on them, or freeing them... probably not.",
  "I can. Deep down, we do know what's happening to them.",
  "We never met them in the old world. Although one of them *is* named Tim. Just a coincidence, I think, unless it was a subconscious thing on our part.",
  "Why? Just so you can torture yourself?",
  "She screams her fear to the open air, but none beside her hear it.",
  "I'm sorry. I know it's hard.",
  "So? What are we thinking?",
  "They'll suffer either way.",
  "You don't really believe he'd do it?",
  "This took a dark turn.",
  "Well, hopefully it won't come to that.",
  "I think we just keep walking.",
  "I kind of expected him to have interrupted already."
